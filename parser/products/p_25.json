Keep in mind however, that they have a very objective sound. I use them professionally many hours per day and their value for money is by far the best out there! ;"},{"q":"Would these be suitable for listening to music on PC whilst working/studying?","a":"Probably in a quiet room, but they let noise in and out. Also, they're a bit too good for a standard PC headphone output to be honest, and it may not be powerful enough to drive them well. They're comfortable for hours on end though & the sound doesn't fatigue the ears too much."},{"q":"How much sound do these headphones leak? Will they irritate fellow commuters?","a":"I can't tell, I've never listened to someone else use them. I can tell you they aren't meant for travel, they are studio headphones. While they are reasonably sturdy, they aren't going to take the punishment of daily commutes."},{"q":"Do they leak sound on full volume ?","a":"Yes, any semi open or open back headphones will. If you want no leakage you'll need closed back."},{"q":"What's the difference between semi- open and closed back with regard, to home studio recording, and which is best suited to the task?","a":"Closed back generally don’t leak sound for others. Literally meaning no openings on the back of the units. Open backs mean more sound can escape. Personally I like open backs for home recordings as less internal claustaphobic feel and the air moves better- giving a more acoustic vibe. Also are easier to wear for long sessions."},{"q":"Can i plug akg headphones into a laptop","a":"yes, of course . it comes with adapter for different size jacks"},{"q":"Can i connect them to a laptop","a":"Yes, you can connect these to a laptop.  Sound quality will depend on the audio chip set and and software.  I have used them with Realtek  audio and they sound pretty good."},{"q":"Are these headphones suitable for commuting?","a":"I would say they wouldn't be ideal due to their size and the fact they would leak a lot of sound both ways."},{"q":"Do these contain leather?","a":"Pretty sure artificial leather, however earpads can be replaced. https//www.akg.com/Headphones/Professional%20Headphones/K240MKII.html"},{"q":"Why do you state that it is free postage and then try to charge for post at the checkout?","a":null},{"q":"Are these headphones good for using through a guitar amp? I want to play my guitar without annoying my neighbours","a":"Never used with a guitar amp, I do use them for mixing and have played guitar into them through my ableton setup. They sound decent."},{"q":"Does these contain leather?","a":"The band and included earmuffs are leatherette fake leather."},{"q":"What is the difference between those and the k240 mkii's?","a":"Personally I thought the ones looked more retro and better build."},{"q":"Do these headphones require an amp?","a":"No amp is needed"},{"q":"If they are studio headphones will my Denon amp drive them suffiiciently","a":"Generally speaking, amplifiers are a safer bet than portable devices etc. These are not particularly demanding and my amplifier drives them well."},{"q":"How many ohms","a":"55 ohms"},{"q":"Would these headphones be suitable for using with a kindle fire HDX?","a":"I think so, as they come with a mini jack and adaptor for a 1/4 jack."},{"q":"Are theses ok for filmmaking?","a":"I honestly don't recommend them at all. You can get far better for the money. They're also wickedly uncomfortable."},{"q":"Does these contain leather?","a":"I don't think the material is leather.  They are comfortable to wear and durable in construction. My criticism would be that they are not quite loud/full-sounding enough for my preference."},{"q":"I need help, these headphones or the samson sr850? i'm going to be using them strictly for mixing/mastering? cheers!","a":""},{"q":"Has anybody had problems with the wires becoming loose inside the akg k240 mkii ? thanks.","a":"No. But like all wired products; if you pull them too much, etc. they will come loose .... Paul"},{"q":"Do these contain leather?","a":"NO,  you get velour and vinyl pads in the box. some say Beyerdynamic EDT-990V pads upgrade the phones well."},{"q":"Is the cable coiled or straight, and how long is it?","a":"Straight and about 9 or 10 feet long. I returned mine because I found the sound very artificial compared to the K271"},{"q":"do the insides of these headphones touch your ear? my last pair did and became uncomfortable to wear for long so i'm looking for some that don't","a":"No they don't. They are comfortable but loose. I have to wear a wooly hat underneath to stop them falling off. And they leak sound."},{"q":"Can anyone compare these akg k240 mkii to the akg k240 studio? what is the difference?","a":""},{"q":"Are these okay to use while recording an instrument as your playing E.G drums","a":"I use these for practice and recording. I play bass and the response is good. I use a Behringer audio interface plugged into a Mac."},{"q":"do these have a inline mic","a":"No"},{"q":"is the cable fully detachable?","a":"Yes it is detachable."},{"q":"dO THESE HE\\DPHONES 'SPILL' SPUND","a":"Some external output because they are semi-open. The spillage is minor but they are better suited to mixing than recording."},{"q":"Would these be good for guitar plugging into an amp or would they sound distorted  and grainy?","a":"They sound good plugged into a headphone socket on any amplifier or a mixing desk as long as they are not over-driven.  They do use these in recording studios so they have a good record!  Hope this helps."}],"reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","content":"I use the AKG K240 Mk II in a very hi end  Leema/Naim purely headphone system costing £4k. I mention this only to say I listen at such an audiophile level thatany weaknesses in the chain would be revealed glaringly.\nWhen people suggest the AKG K240s have weaknesses I suggest they do not, they are made for studio use to reveal weaknesses in the recording chain. In my experience of Stax,Audeze, Sennheiser, Beyerdynamic  et etc the AKG 240s are THE ONLY headphone I have used that do not have inherent weaknesses, but purely reveals them. Considering the thousands of pounds I have spent/auditioned on headphones their cost is truly remarkable.\nMisconceptions:-\nThey don't have bass - any headphone that extends to 15hz has more bass depth than humans can hear. I have recordings electronic keyboard tracks with 20 hz basslines, the lowest humans or CD can do and these are clearly audible on my system as are 20hz tones.\n You may not have a system that can reproduce these, you may not like the \"correct\" bass levels studio headphones give, but they clearly do have deepbass if not in any exaggerated amount.\nThey have too much treble - well not if you go to concerts and listen to live cymbals they don't. You may have a system that does not reproduce treble perfectly, but if you do the K240s reproduce it perfectly.\nSo I would say blame your equipment, blame your recordings, blame your ears, but don't blame your K240s. Are they totally perfect headphones ? No. The original cushions are too uncomfortable for long sessions, but £25 Beyerdynamic 990 pads cure that. The original cable is not up to standard, but you can buy a Van Damme OFC pro cable with neutrik plugs for £30. Does this make it perfect? Well in 40 years of serious listening it is as close as anything I've heard comes if partnered to the best equipment. And for a total of £125 for\nheadphones, pads & cable that makes it an absolute  bargain when it surpasses everything I've owned/heard at ten times the cost & more.\nSo save your money on mega price headphones and spend it on a great front end & amplification. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"Sometimes positive reviews are not necessarily helpful, these headphones are awful!. Now to clarify, they do sound OK but the one massive flaw is the base response! OMG it's terrible, they distort way too soon, not even near 70% volume and they are no loud at all. When you increase volume to bring them to life it better be classical music otherwise the low end ruins everything! I've tried Pre-amp, headphone amplifier, EQs and they are thoroughly out perfomered by AKG tuned Samsung Galaxy Note 8/9 S8/9 earphones which I was hoping to replace because I prefer cans.\nSo disappointed indeed, I know people listen to different kinds of music and not just base heavy but I would have liked even a little \"handling\" of low end.\nI wouldn't recommend these for your typical MP3 FLAC mobile phone music. Samsung AKG earphone are £10 on Genuine Accessories UK and AKG did a much better job with those."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"I purchased these in June this year, about 2 weeks ago i started getting audio loss and crackling in the left headphone, today i finally got time in my studio to start producing music again, and the left has cut out all together now.\nSo i tested these K240 on an external USB audio device and via a rackmount piece of equipment and still the same no sound in the left. So i thought i better check the phones output on my rackmount mixer with other headphones, i tested with an ancient pair of Sony headphones and also my AKG K52 headphones and all fine with the mixer and other equipment i tested K240 on. So now i will see what the customer services are like with warranty etc.\nAlso the AKG K52 sound a lot better through my mixer so save yourself a few quid and get the K52.\nUpdate: Now the replacement set AKG 240 STUDIO are doing the same, so i was directed to tech support where the person on the phone did'nt seem to know what a 19\" rack mount mixer was, Waste of Time................."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I really wanted to like these as AKG make fantastic headphones. I had struggled with large headphones before, but the reviews kept saying how comfortable they were.\nMy Honest experience was: The sound was certainly very very flat and would be great for recording. But so flat the bass is just not really there? I get the need for reference headphones as been recording professionally for decades. But I must be missing something?\nThe deal breaker was the feel on my head. I'm 6ft 3 and though more comfortable than others, after 30 mins the back of my head and ears were just getting to hot and pressurised for comfort. My conclusion is that for some large cans will be fine but for others they just will be an ordeal.\nBut I'm sure many will like them and hope I'm just in the minority.\nLastly you can't easily just plug them into your iPhone as the volume is so low, so really only for recording via an audio interface etc"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I ordered this headphones due to great expert reviews. I use them for mixing. I'M used to all sort of headphones and studio monitors.\nThis AKG's are not expensive compared to sound quality they give. I use them for mixing, video editing, background music listening and dedicated music listening. I plug them on my Smartphone to listen to the radio station, iPod, PC, TV... They give similar quality sound out of any source (even from smartphone which is rather lower quality, and I rarely listened it, before this AKG's. It's OK for radio stations though).\nCONS: The actual built quality is very fine, but they look like a cheap clone of some premium product. Much cheaper consumer phones I have looks more premium than these. But this is pure aesthetic opinion. Who looks at them while in darkened studio :)\nPROS (just some of it): I praise mostly the flat response throughout whole spectrum. This is only headphone I have which do not need EQ adjustment.\nI like how easy and 'polite' sound this headphone produce. I mean they make smooth and pleasant sound even with MP3's, and I like to listen very complex music through them, which I would never on lower quality phones.\nThey are comfortable! I'm prone to headache because of headphones, if they are not over ear and big enough. AKG provide vinyl and velour ear pads. I could not decide which are more comfortable. I ended using vinyl on one side and velour on other. I can't tell the difference. Even after long time sweat is on both side. Maybe a drop less on velour side. But I do not sweat much under these. Opposite to other phones I have. It means great spare ear pads already included :)\nCable: There are two of them. Again good. I can change connection on headphone rather than on hard to reach PC output when I work on a PC. Other twisted cable I use for all other uses, because it is shorter. Cable is bulky and heavy compared to consumer products, a bit hard too. But I believe it will last long. But I can always buy new one, since phones have XLR mini connector.\nSelf adaptive overhead strap is comfortable. I'm bald and very sensitive on top of my head. Most other phones gives me pain after hour or so. I often forget them on while working on PC, even after I'm done with what I listened.\nGreat product and even Amazon delivery was faster than estimate.\nEDIT: After 4 months of usage I must take ONE STAR away from my initial review due to wearing comfort. I do not sweat under either of pads, but head and ears becomes so worm under and I'm prone to get headacke after a while. This is more prominent with vinyl pads. Pads are rather hard and unpleasant on skin. Under ears where no hair grows they soon stick to skin. While velour pads gives me better feel on skin and they worm up inside less, they also have smaller inside diameter (they are thicker padded) which means that they are not all around the ears but presses on my ears at edges which starts to hurt me after while. Workaround is to move them around a bit to \"catch\" ears inside pads. But that makes another problem: Velour part of pads are heat-glued together with plastic inner part where seams would be in vinyl pads, in the middle of inside diameter. That \"seam\" is quite hard with sharp edges, so sometimes it hurts me. I wish pads would be made out of better quality or even leather (I would buy upgrade pads if I knew they were better quality).\nOther negative is very heavy and sturdy coiled cable, because much of the weight is concentrated on short lenght. Coiled part begins 60 cm after headphone, which is just fine if you sit at the table. Than all weight lays on the table. But soon as you move coiled part falls down and than all weight is on one side of head. I tend to change cable depend on usage. While straight cable is soft and light, coiled one is hard, sturdy and heavy. Probably good for some rough enviroment, but for calm studio work I wish lighter and more flexible cable (as straight is). I still rather use coiled one, because is shorter.\nUsing this hard cable becomes a problem if connected to some portable device (iPod or smarthpone), because its heavier than device and device tends to fall from desk if cable fells on my knees while seating.\nMaybe I'm picky but I found myself that I do not use this phones as much as I thought. Often I use \"regular\" HiFi phones of I do not mix, because they are more comfortable.\nPS: some claims that this phones are hard to drive. That is correct to some level. Fore professional gear there is no problem. But if connected on PC internal sound card, sound will not be powerfull. I own Brainwawz AP001 headphone amplifier. That make whole difference on PC output. And not so much difference in iPod. So it depends on device output. But connecting headphones to good source is revarding."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These really are excellent, with that trademark AKG transparency and effortless reproduction.\nNothing seems strained, harsh or pushed with these headphones, providing an astonishingly clean and level response.\nThey're also light and very comfortable, even after the 2 hour session I just had while trying them with various inputs covering solo piano, piano plus orchestra, solo voice - bass, tenor and soprano - cathedral choir, solo pipe organ both sweetly fluty and French reeds roaring: everything so clean and sparkling clear to the extent that a faint hum is clearly audible on a \"professional\" recording.\nDefinitely recommended."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I used to have a pair of AKG K140 headphones but these were falling apart after many years of excellent service!  I love the AKG phones as they always produce a very naturally equalised sound but also able to deliver power.  So, what would I choose.  I avoided the obvious K141 as I play Bass and mix music and sometimes the spill from the K140's was really noticeable.  I opted for the K240 Mk II and boy am I pleased!  Far less spillage with the circum aural design and wow, what quality and clarity these produce.  Live sound is natural, MP3 sounds good and original CD is brilliant.  I am not dissapointed with these, in fact, even after just a few hours of use they have surpassed my expectations.  You would have to purchase a serious pair of studio phones to beat these.  Only one minor point, the plastic muffs do make your ears fairly warm after a few hours use but hey, you cant really use anything else apart from maybe some fine leather.  Don't forget, AKG (a force on their own) are owned by Top spec HiFi company, Harman.  PS comes with a spare set of ear muffs and a coiled lead (I like the original straight cord)."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is not a Beats-like headphone. If you want something that you can use when walking in the street, this should not be your choice. It is designed for professional use, such as in a studio, which means that it won't have any extra modification, effect or enhancement in any frequency band.\nIt will provide you with the most genuine sound the music should be, just as you need in a studio."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Blown away. These are legendary headphones that have been around in some form since the 70s. There's a reason why they are still around.\nNice flat response that have improved my mixes by leaps and bounds. If you're on the fence, don't be.\nI read some people complaining about  the bass. If you're expecting big bass like Beats headphones, you'll be disappointed. Beats are not flat response headphones and are tuned to increase the bass. These are for mixing/mastering to give you a true reflection on the sound.\nThese are awesome. Especially for their purpose as studio headphones.\nBuy them."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Absolutely outstanding monitoring headphones. Some say the bass response is inadequate; that has not been my experience. Some people say that semi open headphones are not useful for recording because the sound bleeds into the microphone. Again, not my experience. I use them for editing film dialogue as well as music. So all in all a perfect all round headphone - you may find better, but not for this price."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Long Story in short. All My studio equipment got stollen in 2014 apart from these headphones as I took it with me to France when the incident happened. I had to start over again as I didn't have insurance to cover to stolen equipment. I was broke and baught a simple pc, fl studio no midi keyboard no studio monitors, the only thing I had was these headphones. When I tell you I produced some of the best music, these headphones saved my life. The quality of the headphones was amazing, it's not base driven which is great, in fact it's perfect for mastering music so wjat you hear is what you'll get. About 2 years ago I had lost them, my music hasn't been the same since. Now I have better equipment but something is still missing... 2019 I've decided to get one of these headphones again so it can bring back that sound I need for perfection."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"TL;DR: The bass on these headphones lacks fullness and is not fun to listen to. I'm far from a basshead, but I can safely say these cans are anemic in the bass department, and I am returning them for this reason.\nI ordered these cans along with Beyerdynamic DT 770s (which are closed-back headphones) because both piqued my interest and couldn't decide which one to get. So I decided to test both together, keep one and return the other. My laptop has crappy onboard sound, so I also ordered a FiiO K1 USB DAC, which despite its cheap price point, has excellent sound, virtually indistinguishable from the sound of my iPod (which is known to have a great internal DAC). Disclaimer: Other than that, my experience with premium headphones comes from listening to my trusty Sennheiser HD 598s for many years, which I regrettably don't have with me and cannot be part of this comparison.\nMy testing method involved many several hours' worth of repeating various ~10-second passages over and over, quickly switching between both headphones and listening for the differences, using dozens of songs from many different genres. While both headphone's sound signatures are surprisingly similar to my ears (and both are meant to be analytical headphones for studio use), the k240 is glaringly lacking in bass power by comparison. Even simple kick drums lack almost all thump, blending in with non-percussion instruments. I'm not at all a basshead (I mostly listen to progressive/alternative rock and instrumental/classical music), but between two headphones that otherwise sound quite similar, but one of them lacks something, of course I'm going to pick the one that doesn't lack it.\nThe k240 does have a slightly wider soundstage (turns out the DT 770 has pretty good soundstage despite its closed design!), but it's not enough to compensate the bass anemia. This is not a genre-specific issue: even orchestral music is affected by this problem, for even something as simple as a marching band drum will lack \"oomph\" on these cans.\nAs the final nail in the coffin, even the earbuds that came with my phone have fuller bass than these cans."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great sounding headphones and comfortable to wear. You get two types of earpads either plain sponge or leather effect and two cables a normal cable or a coiled cable.\nWith my old Sony headphones the audio from my mixer sounded very bassy and lacking in high frequencies, but these AKG K240's just sound great across the whole audio frequency spectrum.\nI Highly recommended the AKG K240 headphones.\nLes."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"As someone who listens to a lot of heavy metal/rock music I can honsetly say these headphones are great. I was worried about them being semi open but decided to give them a try anyway.\nYes other people in the room can hear your music so not the sort of headphones you want to wear riding public transport. No outside noise leaking in even when the other half was banging on about something. Just smile and nod while Faith No More take you to your happy place.\nI listen to bass heavy music, the sound is very good with much more power than my 15 year old Technics...obviously. They even make the ipod Classic Touch sound bareable so they're alright by me."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Brilliant headphones. If you're doing basic mixing or want to listen to music and hear it \"clear\", with no boost in bass etc, very good choice. These are not personal headphones - will probably not survive more than a month in your bag in the bus but will work perfectly if you take care of them at home or in the studio. The only issue for me is that they're quite tight fitting - after couple of hours, my ears start aching. Can't go wrong for this amount of money."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"My friend must have recommended these 50 times before I finally went for it. They've almost halved in price from when I first looked them up. Sound amazing through my Focusrite Scarlett 18i20 headphone monitor. Absolute bargain!"},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Returned as suitable mostly for studio use. I seem not to like the sound of AKG. My second different pair not liked. Spend a bit more and get a pair of 'Grado's'. Much better sound SR80e. The difference is like chalk and cheese."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I have the 240 MkII (bought in 2008) and still love them to bits. I recently purchased this for a family member and the sound quality is great. At a price around £40, I might get another pair. Can't see why would someone spend more when you can have this top quality at this price. I wish they came with a coil lead and a second set of ear cushions like my 240 MkII did."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"You cannot go wrong with this headphone.\nSound is extremely good, especially for the price. It is exactly what it says on the tin - balanced and accurate. Trebles, mids and bass are all reproduced well and neither exceed nor lack in any area. The bass increase setting on my FiiO E10 works very well for when you want a more bassy sound - but it sounds great normally.\nThe sound is very clear and many details in your music will be brought out. I was surprisingly impressed by the sound stage which is quite large and airy, probably due to the semi-open design. You don't feel the music is inside your head which is something I personally dislike. This also means that those nearby will hear your music, so bear that in mind. It's not noise cancelling either so you will be able to hear your surroundings.\nAt 55ohms impedance it's fairly easily driven. It's comfortably loud at half volume on low amplification setting on a Fii0 E10. It doesn't need an amp for most situations but a good headphone amp will certainly bring the best out of it. Everything is clearer and generally better.\nIt's very comfortable to wear, one of the most comfortable headphones I've tried. It is very light and does not strongly clamp your head. It feels like you could wear it all day.\nBuild and design is fairly good. It's not particularly pretty but it's for listening to not looking at. It feels a little flimsy and feels it could break if twisted or pulled too much, but this shouldn't be a problem if you look after it. It doesn't creak however and feels generally well made - it's just light.\nYou get a decent length 3.5mm straight cable and a coiled cable. It comes standard with leatherette ear pads and an alternative pair of velvet ear pads. Both are comfortable. You also get a 6.5mm jack adapter.\nOverall, highly recommended."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I've been using these for studio and tv work. They are very comfortable for long sessions and they sound pretty good. Cable is long and feels good quality and the cans look sexy! Great value"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Bought these for electronic music production and just listening to music at home & they are ideal. When I took them out the box they felt incredibly light and didn't seem sturdy- they have a fairly cheap plastic-like feel. I have now had them for about half a year and have had absolutely no problems whatsoever- I have put these things in a rucksack with no case and taken them on the train and they've been fine (I wouldn't recommend doing this though). The fact that you can change the cord is a very handy feature- I have gone for the telephone style coil and have never had any problems.\nAs for the sound they are fantastic- I would say the bass is very subtle compared to some of the headphones I have used (there is a review on here saying that the low end is overpowering- they MUST have been reviewing the wrong headphones) but it works well as it makes a lot more room for mid and high frequencies. I was looking for something fairly flat with regards to frequency response and I think these are ideal, but admittedly I haven't tried a great deal of pro headphones.\nThe one real criticism I would have is that your ears get too hot after about 2 hours and you have to take them off for a while- but I don't know any headphones which aren't like this. I would definitely recommend these headphones to anyone for their reasonable price, sturdiness (even though they might not seem sturdy to start off with), comfort and well balanced sound."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great for studio as a fairly flat unbiased sound.and very comfortable.\nnot so good playing guitar when I have to bend over to adjust settings on foot peddles as they tend to slip a bit"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"A lot of leakage compared to other semi-open headphones, they are just as loud standing next to them a a fully-open set, but for comfort and sound quality and price you can't go wrong. The closed back AKGs might be an option if sound leakage is an issue but there might be some compromise in sound quality (I presume,, I've not tried them). That said, I've seen photographs / video of Queen and John Lennon using the original version of these, semi-open, for vocal takes.. so if good enough for them, who cares about a little extra over spill! Probably not worth worrying too much about.. Sounds great for monitoring electric guitar and bass. For production might want to consider the AKG reference, fully-open option for flatter response. Saying that these are a pretty flat response, good natural sounding and clear definition between instruments and the sound is big and wide. A great product and fast delivery."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I love these headphones, theyre good for music productions and general listening as well, really nice sound stage and clear sound, they are 100% worth the price in my opinion and much better than the over advertised competitors that charge more."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"After reading all the reviews I decided to replace my old headphones I used as a DJ over 30 years ago.\nI am pleasantly surprised of the build quality and the detachable cord.
