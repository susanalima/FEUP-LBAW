I do programming and I learned to type way back when so I'm used to shift being used to get the symbol ABOVE the normal key symbol not below it. As such I couldn't use the normal Cherry switches unless I used a non backlit keyboard which in my office would have meant some kind of overhead lighting which I didn't really want.\nNow I've got this keyboard, I wouldn't go back to cherry keys. Not only are these keys quieter than my old MX Browns but they also don't suffer with as much wobble which means I can type quicker and be more sure I'm pressing the right keys.\nI've used this keyboard for writing English and programming in SQL and it does the job excellently. I also game using it both FPS and RTS (not sure which World of Warships comes under but that as well). In game the keys are admirable and despite running them through a USB switch (effectively a KVM switch) I've noticed no input lag nor have I found issues using the keyboard. The software which goes with the keyboard Logitech G Hub does sometimes fail to recognise I've started a game and doesn't switch profiles but a quick Alt+Tab to the desktop or another app and then back in again and it works fine. Other than that the level of control is excellent and the layout is about as non technical as you can expect with all of these features.\nNow down to the pretty bit, the RGB.\nYes these aren't the brightest of lights. There's no spill and it won't light up a room but I like that. What is does do is light each key's characters evenly and in whatever colour you so choose (except white of course which is blueish on almost all RGB keyboards) and the effects you can program are wonderful. It's a real nice feature to mirror your desktop colours in the keyboard (yes it really does look cool and quite understated in my opinion) and if you want to have a ripple effect then I was shocked how well that worked.\nTLDNR\nGreat keys (Romer-G > Cherry MX Browns) for quietness, less wobble and typing comfort\nGood lighting, not amazingly bright but well lit and with great effects.\nGaming - the software works well and you can set up things to your hearts desire\nOverall looks, it's brushed black with a comfy wrist wrest and doesn't take up your whole desk - In other words, just about perfect."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I purchased this to use in work as the standard keyboards don't feel right.\nHaving better key travel than a cheap keyboard is important for rapid typing and this keyboard fits the bill for me.\nI can't testify to it's use as a gaming keyboard. It is heavier than a standard keyboard, and less likely to be jogged accidentally. The key travel is good and the keys not too loud.\nThere is an additional USB port on the keyboard, which could be used for plugging in a flash drive or mouse.\nMy only gripe is that it does use TWO USB ports and it is not clear is if I can get away with using just one."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I got this to replace a Corsair K95 RGB (brown). Compared to that, this is practically a TKL! I really love the design, it's pretty bare bones for a gaming brand keyboard, you wouldn't think this was from the same minds as the orion spark!.\nI happen to like the Romer G switches, preferring it to the browns on the K95 (the shorter travel is great). The RGB looks really nice.\nThe wrist rest, it's glorious. Lovely wrist pillow thing! Hope it lasts..."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Love the keyboard. I did a lot of research about the romar-g tactile switch before ordering it. The switch feels between cherry brown and cherry red.

Highly recommend to anyone looking for a full RGB keyboard with soft brown switch."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"What idiot design's a gaming keyboard with no num-lock indicator led..

The board itself is very well made - very heavy but also very minimal in size, and the USB cable is thick and braided for duarbility. The key action is very smooth, responsive and accurate. There is not a click as I have had with other keyboards, but it is not silent or spongy. The included wrist pad is very comfortable and there are a set of the commonly used gaming keys with raised edges provided to help the hardcore player. A USB socket is provided on the keyboard for attaching peripherals without needing to access the computer - although the \"extra\" USB socket is a bit of a misnomer as the keyboard itself takes up two sockets on the back of the computer.\nThe LED backlighting is the most obvious feature visually, and it is very effective. Bright and responsive. The keys can be selected to light up in various modes - to mirror the screen, respond to music or respond to a particular game. Without the backlighting the keys are nigh on impossible to see but you can select colour and brightness to suit your taste and your mood.\nI would have liked an instruction guide in the box - mine had nothing but a web address and a picture on how to plug in the USB socket. But otherwise I can not find a fault with this keyboard - it is simply excellent!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Very solid keyboard.\nWith an aluminium frame, this weighs in at three times the weight of a cheap plastic keyboard, meaning it won’t move about under intensive gaming use.\nIt has two USB cables to plug in, one supplies the pass through USB socket on the rear of the keyboard.\nThis is useful for plugging in a USB stick or gaming key or even the gaming mouse or even USB headphones/speakers.\nThe keyboard has mechanical switches giving a feedback tactile click when pressed, it also means you can pound the keys during gaming joy, if that is your thing.\nColours, once again Logitech have lit the actual keys, not the back board, which is far superior and less dazzling.\nColour patterns can be changed by downloading the software. As usual with Logitech products there are zero instructions, it’s up to you to download the software drivers and configuration and work out how to use it.  However it’s pretty easy and the intended audience should have no problems with that. You also get an unconnected soft wrist rest to help with sore wrists from repetition action(!)\nConclusion, strong sold keyboard with pretty lights and mechanical tactile keys, but also doubles as a solid weapon to swat lurking Ruskie spies who sneak up behind you in your geek den."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This keyboard is pretty great, though I don't have a lot to compare it to. I don't game, so can't vouch for its effectiveness for that but I've been searching for a new keyboard because of RSI. I read that mechanical keys can help with this, and I wanted something that with keys that were less flat and tight. The first one I bought solved the core problem I had, but gave me an extra issue with reaching for the backspace key.\nThis one seems to have solved my RSI problems so for me that's job done. It's a pleasure to type with. The default setting of the LED colours is a rippling rainbow looks great but incredibly irritating if you're trying to use the keyboard for any length of time. Luckily the Logitech App, which is ready to download from their website, is easy to use and can easily be set to a variety of different static patterns and colours. The kids love this aspect and I'm forever discovering the keyboard has a new look.\nThe keys and colours are fully customizable with lots of different options. You can configure the keyboard for individual games, which is handy if you need it"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"This is a very solid and robust keyboard\n+ the memory foam wrist rest is lovely.

This is the nature of the tactile switches but it’s not a quiet keyboard.\n- keys felt a bit small sometimes.\n- the double USB cable (which only needs both plugged in if wanting to use the pass through) is very thick which means you need a minimum distance between PC and keyboard.\nOverall a brilliant keyboard with a few niggles. The main one for me being the very thick cable. I have my gaming laptop near the keyboard and the thickness of the wire made it difficult to place without cables going everywhere.\nOther than that, very customisable, very comfortable and great key response.\nThe software allows almost everything to be customised and the colour options and brilliant."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"This is a very impressive keyboard.  It looks and feels well made, likely to withstand some clumsiness whilst being easy to use too.  I`ve not had much to do with gaming keyboards since... well, the early 90s, or earlier! - so I`ve had to get back into the habit a little and maybe that`s one of the reasons I didn`t instantly fall in love with it, but it does look so cool you can`t help but like it.  The display and colours are very neat, and the response time is instant and I haven`t felt and other than occasionally pressing wrong keys, which is more because I`m refamilarising myself with a keyboard that isn`t just for emails at work, I really like this."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is a nice looking and comfortable keyboard. The Inuit has a backlit light show and a full length wrist guard that makes using this with its soft keystrokes lovely to use.\nNow I'm not a gamer so I just use it as an ordinary keyboard which is a pleasure. There are many functions this can undertake but sadly my knowledge of them is very limited however my son reports that it is a fantastic piece of kit and keeps threatening to pinch it but he has another gaming keyboard and says this is way better by far. It has many more functions and the keys are lovely to type with.\nLooks great on the desk"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"First impression of this keyboard - heavy! It's based on a roughly 2 kg slab of aluminium - it looks and feels expensive, and certainly won't go sliding around the desk from overzealous key-stabbing.\nIt has a very positive movement under the fingers, and is an absolute pleasure to use whether writing or gaming. It's just a shame that keyboards of this level don't seem to be made in the ergonomic curved shapes. However after using it for a few thousand words and for a session of Elite: Dangerous (joystick and keyboard), it does definitely feel worth it for heavy keyboard users."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Much heavier than I was expecting for a keyboard. Connection to the computer was very quick and easy. Very responsive. The keys are a little noisier than I had hoped but after a while I didn't notice it as much."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"The carbon is a heavy, metal-faced, robust-feeling keyboard built with gaming in mind, but also suitable for other tasks. The weight, together with good rubber feet, makes it steady as a a rock. The tactile keys are proper mechanical keys with a good travel and a loud clackety-sound. The keys are surface-mounted, meaning that their entire travel is above the plane of the keyboard surface, with an underhang visible. There’s a USB pass-through port on the right end of the rear panel, and there’s a tripod-style screw fixing on the back, so the keyboard could presumably be suspended in mid-air, given a suitable mounting bracket. I can imagine it being used in game demo booths in shops and at conventions. Note that to use the USB_pass-through, the keyboard needs two USB ports on your PC; otherwise, you only need one, but are left with a dangling plug.\nOther than the LED lighting, there are no bells and whistles, no extra keys or mini-display windows. It’s just a good, no-nonsense heard-wearing, responsive keyboard. A keyboard for serious gaming, in fact. There is one very slight design defect: the front corner of the spacebar is quite sharp, and as that’s the bit I press, it is a little uncomfortable when typing. But of course, this keyboard is really meant for gaming. The size of the keyboard is just about perfect: it’s a full-size keyboard, but with only about 10 mm of space round the outer edges of the keyboard: there’s no wasted space, so it doesn’t take up any more room than it needs to. I don't use the supplied palm rest.\nThere’s a key-removal tool and some alternate keys provided for the main movement keys. These keys have a different profile, so you can find them easily by touch. Not recommended if you’ll also by typing on the same keyboard.\nThe software, which you must download, will detect your installed games, but you can add more manually. It knows the standard keyboard layout for many games, but it also supports macros and all sorts of other options. The profile editor is called “Customise G-Keys”. Choose or add a profile from the top, then if you want to record a macro or assign a new key press the “+” in the Commands window. You can set up hotkeys including (controversially) Alt-F4 for those times you may want to quit your game in a hurry.\nIf you want the profile to switch automatically when you start a game, you need to tell the Logitech software what executable to monitor. Within the profile editor (”Customise G-Keys”) click on the little down-arrow on the profile you want to associate, choose “Properties” and “+”. You can then navigate to the game executable and add it. The keyboard will now automatically change profile - and lighting - when you launch and exit your game.\nThere are loads of lighting settings, many of them more decorative than useful: I’m not sure I want coruscating fire under my fingers as I try to play a game. The useful options are to set a fixed colour for all the keys; “Zones”, which highlights blocks of keys (for example W,A,S,D, number keys, function keys and the arrow keys) in different colours; and (best of all) “Freestyle”, which allows you to set a colour for every key individually. For a game like Frontier Developments’ Elite: Dangerous, which has an awful lot of keys to remember, having all the keys lit up in blocks of colour (main engine thrust one colour, manoeuvring thrusters a different colour, targeting keys another colour again - see the picture) is extremely useful. You can turn off the lights altogether for keys you don’t use; the key effectively turns black, so you only see the keys you need.\nYou can also toggle the keyboard into game mode (there’s an LED to show when you’re in this mode), and you can customise what keys will be disabled (the Windows key and the Context menu buttons are disabled by default in game mode).\nIf for any reason you want to tell what keys you’re pressing frequently - and this can be useful if you want to find out what customisations, colours and macros you may want to set - there’s a utility in the software for that too.\nThis really is an excellent piece of no-nonsense robustness."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I can remember using the old Cherry keyboards that came with older PCs, there was a time they were the only ones you could get. Then lighter, slimmer, quieter keyboards came along (probably due to the evolving technology in laptops), then the PS/2 port (is a 6-pin mini-DIN connector) gave way to USB and then wireless options using wifi and bluetooth. The Cherry keyboards still had a cult following, they never really went away\nThis keyboard uses Logitech's custom design Romer-G linear switches, and are the equivalent to the Cherry MX Brown. These are a compromise over gaming and general typing. Also, as they're not the same as the (universal) Cherry series, finding different key caps is pretty much off the board, however replacement keys are more the lookout for enthusiasts, not casual gamers.\nSmart looking box that as soon as you pick it up you realise it's heavy, over well a kilogram! The full size keyboard is separate from the wrist rest and you see the base is one solid piece of brushed black aircraft grade aluminum-magnesium alloy.  Very nice. Connection is by a very thick and not very flexible double USB cable and there's a USB 2.0 pass through socket on the back right (for wired/wireless dongle mouse or memory stick, etc). Note you only need to connect one of the USB cables to power the G513, it's the one with the handy little keyboard icon on the USB connector. There's also a strange 1/4\" screw thread on the back (that no one knows what it could be for as yet).\nIncluded in the box are a selection of replacement with 12 replacement keys: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Q, W E, R, A, S, D and a plastic keycap remover. These are the standard gaming keys and the alternatives are a different shape so you can find them without needing to look (and getting fragged in the process). There aren't any dedicated programmable buttons and no dedicated media buttons either (though they are integrated into the function keys), so that could be a deal breaker for some.\nThe lighting is on another level. The LEDs are at the bottom of what they call a light pipe and I prefer that to the 'floating key' / exposed switch design, I don't need the ambient glow around the keys no matter how cool it looks. There's no LED no bleed through, the whole key is lit evenly so you see the letters/numbers/characters perfectly clearly. That includes those secondary characters on the front of the key.  The keys are bright and the colours are vivid.\nThe palm rest is separate, so you can choose to use it or not. It's made of leatherette and memory foam and I found it the right height for the keyboard. It's also meant to be water and sweat proof. There's no way of hooking it up to the keyboard though, but its six rubber feet stop it from moving about and you can position it just where you want.\nIt's not a quiet keyboard, typing late at night you're aware that it can be heard all through the house.  I am going to buy these o rings:\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Keyboard-Dampeners-Plastic-Storage-Mechanical/dp/B0761TSWF3/\nAs they should dampen the noise by over half and because they're translucent, they shouldn't affect the colours of the keys.  I'm nowhere near a hardcore gamer, so any micro-second lag is not going to make any difference to me (fragged again, lolz)\nThe downloadable and comprehensive Logitech gaming software controls all aspects of colour and animation and create proifles, though if you don't want to do that, function keys F5 to F8 provide some controls as well.\nAfter using a wireless Logitech keyboard for years it took me a day to get used to this 'old school' wired one, but now I love it. It is expensive and it's not as customisable as a Cherry gaming keyboard, but it is good keyboard."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I previously had a Corsair K95 RGB with Cherry MX Red switches, so moving to the \"tactile\" switches on this version of the Logitech G513 was a bit of a culture shock. Having used the new keyboard for a while I'm used to it. The Cherry Reds are a LOT clickier, whereas the Romer-G Tactile switches have a softer feel but are just as responsive in my experience. I actually have a better time typing on the Romer-G  keys and that surprised me.\nI'd be hard put to fault the hardware. I've used a LONG line of Logitech keyboards in the past and they were pretty much bulletproof. The reason I switched was because the underlying software from Logitech was terrible, lacking automation features which I found necessary. That said, Corsair's CUE software took quite some getting used to but having reinstalled the Logitech Gaming Software I'm actually missing the Corsair product. Both sets of software are horribly unintuitive but the CUE software allows control over pretty much everything and even allows you to set up macros which include mouse clicks and positioning. The Logitech Gaming Software only allows for limited mouse controls, basically button presses and scrolling.\nThe wrist rest is superb. Very comfortable. In fact it's the sort you would be prepared to pay extra for and is much better than the plastic rests which come with even the most premium of other gaming keyboards - those other manufacturers need to be looking at this.\nI've been typing for over forty years and I'm  still very much a four fingers and two thumbs guy. I can touch type adequately if I don't think about it but I still like to check the keyboard every so often. Pitiful I know but I'm sure I'm not alone. Unlit the keytops on the Logitech G513 are useless. You need to tilt your head back to a certain angle just to make them out. It doesn't help that many of the default lighting profiles leave the majority of the keys unlit.\nBy default the FN-F7 key lets you cycle through several brightness options for the LEDs. I don't see a way to set brightness from within the software, so you can't eg have your WASD keys fully bright with the other keys dimmed somewhat. I'm not saying it isn't possible, I just can't see how to do it.\nComes with replacement keycaps for the QWERTY and 12345 keys AND includes a key puller which is very easy to use.\nThe default lighting setting is quite annoying, making it pretty much essential to install the LGS software.\nReally excellent keyboard let down by sub-par software, although to be fair I think the LGS software is basically dumbed down so as not to confuse users. While functionally much worse to use, the CUE software gives you much more control - if only it didn't forget my profiles every so often.\nUnequivocally, if you're not going to be dabbling with macros, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This keyboard is surprisingly heavy, and feels rugged and robust.  The all mechanical key switches have a nice tactile feel and engage well.  I have been used for the last few years to apple keyboards, with their small travel and minimalist key heights, and these are a polar opposite but still very nice to use.  I guess keyboards are a personal thing and you need to try before you buy.  The keys are deep and draw your fingers in, perfect for gaming, which is the principle target audience for this device, although it is also very good for typing, work etc\nThe keyboard comes with several lighting functions, and you can't see the keys unless the lights are on.  I found the streaming through the colours of the rainbow version a bit much, and there is plenty of lighting power, to the extent that it was too bright.  However, there are so many key lighting functions and you can find one you like.  I am particular taken by the one that gives a ray of colour every time you press a key, but more often than not , I simply had etc muted cyan on.\nThe keyboard comes with a memory foam wrist rest, which is very welcome and makes the whole thing a pleasure to use.  My only niggle with this, is that the keyboard features a usb lead through, but you have to plug a second usb connection to make it work.  Not really much use for that.\nIn summary, a pleasure to use and recommended."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great sleek, aluminium carbon frame construction makes this a slick looking keyboard that looks and performs as well.

The keys feature responsive switches giving quiet tactile keys, raised keys makes a much nicer / comfortable keyboard to use. Lack of dedicated multimedia keys at this price is an omission (rather than a fn + F keys). An integrated USB pass through allows connection of USB devices or for charging purposes.\nThe Logitech gaming software, allows adjustment of the RGB illumination, reprogram function keys, create profiles for different games. Not all keys can  reprogram every key but the program is intuitive to use.\nThe real test of a gaming keyboard is how it performs during a gaming session. My games of choice for the testing was Call Of Duty WWII and GTA V. The keyboard is responsive, accurate and comfortable making it a pleasure for gaming.

Cherry switches are defacto switch type.  Logitech some years back brought out their own key switches – Romer-G’s.\nUntil now they have bene good but no Cherry rival.  I consider this changes that.  Available in Linear and Tactile.  Or in basic crude terms, clicky and non-clicky.  Linear are close to reds and tactile browns I guess.\nThe keyboards are well made and look gorgeous.

The keyboard is relatively compact but weighty with excellent backlighting which can be customised by Fn Key and F5; but have settled on the Solid Cyan after initially being mesmerised by the colour waves, breathing, cycling and ripple effects! There is also a handy USB port on the top right-hand side edge of the keyboard which makes up for the fact that the keyboard requires the use of two USB ports to provide the power, using two lengthy braided cables. The keyboard also comes with a deluxe padded robust keyboard wrist-rest which makes typing a lot more comfortable.

The font is very friendly to read. Software is easy to use and very functional. USB passthrough is a nice addition. However, there are some minor \"quality of life\" issues due to the design. The previous issues (which were minor to the G810) were present in this model of the keyboard but some were rectified. Also Romer-G Tactile OR Linear might not suit everyone's taste. Overall a very solid keyboard.\nIntro: I got this keyboard just for the sake of upgrading to a newer Logitech keyboard, so I settled on the G513 Tactile. Needless to say I was just as impressed with this as with my previous G810 Orion Spectrum.\nThe key switch: To be clear, Romer-G is Logitech's in-house switch type thats meant to rival the likes of Cherry, Razer, Gateron etc. . I went for the Romer-G Tactile which are like Cherry MX Browns in a way, plus I already used the exact same switches on the G810.\nDesign: I adorn the floating keycap design which other mechanical keyboards have, as this makes it even easier to clean. The keyboard uses a metal backplate and the top plate is also metal which adds rigidity and weight to the keyboard. The overall design of the keyboard is far from the aggressive \"gamer\" look, as this product looks very elegant and modern; turn off the RGB and it fits perfectly in an office environment. Like pretty much all of Logitech's recent gaming keyboards, the RGB comes through the keys itself rather than the light \"spilling\" underneath the keycaps. A soft leather/pleather? wrist rest is included and it is very plush for those who would like to use it.\nFunctionality: its a keyboard with some extra features and RGB lighting to put it quite simply. The extra keyboard functions like media controls are embedded to the F keys above (toggled by an FN key). Making use of the Logitech Gaming Software (LGS), you can fully customise the lighting effects, set macros and even choose which keys are disabled when \"Game Mode\" is activated. This keyboard also comes with a USB passthrough port (thus the keyboard has 2 USBs to plug in) which allows you to plug in any USB device; in my case I plugged my mouse.\nPositives: On the G810 and G910, the bottom of the keystrokes were quite mushy, almost akin to a membrane keyboard; this is 95% rectified on the G513. The font is easy to read and doesnt look gamery at all. The overall footprint is small for a full size keyboard. USB passthrough is very useful to avoid the need to reach the back of your PC to plug a USB device (though this feature should be standard at all price points)\nNegatives: The metallic sound when typing still remains with this keyboard, I already got used to this fact but some of you may dislike the keyboard for this very purpose. 'Normal' keyboards have a SCROLL NUM CAPS light, but this only has Game Mode and CAPS lock lights; a prompt on screen tells you when NUM or SCROLL is active. This will definitely annoy more people since you wont be able to know if its active.\nConclusion: the G513 is a well build keyboard from Logitech and if you are already familiar with the Romer-G keys, then youll feel right at home. I understand that not everyone will like certain aspects of the product. Luckily the consumers still have plenty of choices at this relatively high price point. I would recommend this keyboard to
