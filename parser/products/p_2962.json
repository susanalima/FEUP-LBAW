It's all plastic but it's not super glossy like my old Inspiron so it looks less tacky.\nThe fan was pretty noisy at first but I think a Dell/Windows update has downloaded and fixed this.\nStart-up time is incredible - it takes around 20-30 seconds max from hitting the power button to logging in to Windows 10. The finger print sensor login is a nice touch too.\nWifi and Bluetooth connectivity seems to work flawlessly.\nI was dreading the switch from Windows 7 to Windows 10 but it's been quite a nice experience so far. Things like Calendar synchronisation and Cortana are nice touches. I'm not sure yet if Cortana will replace my trusty Google Now / Assistant on my phone but we'll see. Some of the \"apps\" you can get are pretty nifty too, such as WhatsApp for desktop which allows you to view and reply to your WhatsApp messages without having to pick up your phone.\nNow - the main thing I was worried about - the SCREEN.  I'd read dozens of reviews where the screen quality was a big bone of contention. I can safely say that I worried over nothing - the screen is OK. One of the gripes is that it isn't bright enough.  I think one issue here is that most people have their TV's and other screens cranked up to full brightness, which is not what you're supposed to do (full brightness is supposed to be for display mode in shops to make the screen \"pop\" and stand out under the bright florescent lights). As I type this I currently have my screen brightness set to 50% and it looks fine to me. If the sunlight were really bright I know I've got the option to turn the brightness up further.\nComparing the screen to a good quality external HP monitor that I have running alongside, the colour representation is also pretty good. I'm doing design work on this screen and it's adequate for me. If you're doing specialist photo editing then perhaps you might take issue with it, but then again you'd most likely be using an external monitor anyway.\nFinally, be warned, there is quite a bit of backlight bleed around the edges and corner of the display when you're on a black screen. If you're watching a movie with lots of dark or shadowy scenes, particularly at night, this could be annoying. For me this isn't a problem as I don't really watch movies on my laptop. I also bought a 40\" Samsung TV a few years ago with a similar amount of backlight bleed and clouding and I vented so much frustration over this back then, that I no longer really care.\nOne tip - after booting it up for the first time, via the Windows Defender Security Centre I selected the \"Fresh Start\" option. This removes all of the rubbish and bloatware that Dell includes on the system by default and starts with a reasonably clean Windows install. Afterwards you can update all of the device drivers manually, or download the Dell SupportAssist application from the Dell website which will do this for you. After doing this things run as smooth as ever. I uninstalled some bizarre games that Microsoft includes by default, and cleared out all temporary files and restore points via the Disk Cleanup utility, which freed up an extra 10GB of space on the SSD hard drive.\nAll in all I'm pleased with this system. I looked at a HP equivalents which I liked because their laptop bodies were made from metal rather than plastic. However, it they were more expensive and some models weren't as well spec'd as the Dell."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Excellent value via the warehouse. Suspect returned due to noisy fans but a Bios release has been made which sorts it out. But you have to go through the big Windows 10 updates first so bear with the noise for a few hours then use the Dell Support Assist Tool to update the system."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Well I was very pleased with the Dell 15-3000 laptop. wasn't to sure at first but I am delighted with it real good value for the price.

You would think easy to resolve but Amazon customer services passed me off to Dell and 10 e mails later to Intel and it's still not solved. Everybody's fault but theirs. Customer centric slogan is just that a slogan! AVOID."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"A very good laptop that is fast and performs very well. It does come with a DVD drive and plays DVDs no problem. I have mine connected to a 24 inch monitor and I also bought a wireless key board and mouse which work very well together. There is no noisy fan either.\nIt has a few good features such as finger print recognition. If you have multiple accounts setup on your laptop you just put your finger on the fingerprint reader and it loads your profile. You can turn feature off if you want to.\nIt has a 30 day trial version of Microsoft Office 365 loaded, and if you decide to purchase it I would recommend buying your subscription directly from the Microsoft website. do not get an activation code from Amazon as a lot of them do not work. Going directly to Microsoft is hassle free.\nAn awesome laptop, I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great product...suits my needs perfectly....good price and speedy delivery.
