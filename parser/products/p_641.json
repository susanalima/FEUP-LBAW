I own their latest m5 media tablet and that's fantastic.\nI hope Huawei continues their tech push and improve quality control on stress tests for the chassis creaks too.\nThank you."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"This is a beautiful looking laptop and a serious competitor to Apple Macbook Pro and Microsoft's Surface products. Incredibly compact given the size of the screen, and the edge-to-edge display in particular is amazing and bigger, brighter and more vibrant than for example the Microsoft Surface products. I love the 3:2 aspect ratio screen which is so much more useful than the typical screens found on almost all other laptop brands. Haven't used it much yet, but I'm sure the i5 processor and 256GB performance will be more than adequate for most needs. The keyboard is great to type on - far superior to the latest macbook and almost as good as the surface laptop, and the sound quality is pretty good for a small laptop. Also comes with a useful selection of ports including the much maligned but very practical and durable legacy USB-A, and future proof USB-C, and even an extra dongle, along with a compact USB-C fast charger.\nI also appreciate the fact that, unlike the Macbooks and Surface products it can be opened up to replace or upgrade the SSD. Don't know how much else might actually be repairable or upgradable, but at least the device doesn't need to go back to the OEM just to open the case. Be aware that Huawei state that opening up the device for any reason, even just to upgrade the SSD, will void the warranty.\nHowever, it is expensive for what it is, and there are a few things that I feel let it down. 1. The fan seems to run a lot and it can get quite hot occasionally and battery life, while good falls short of the best in class competitors. The exact same i5 processor running in a Microsoft surface product runs cooler and quieter - perhaps driving the higher resolution display is the issue. I imagine the i7 versions of the matebook X Pro will be noisier and hotter still, while also having shorter battery life, so unless you really need the extra power or RAM for gaming or video editing or similar I really wouldn't go for the i7 versions. 2. The track pad, although smooth and a wonderful large size, has an slight rattle to it that you might expect on a much cheaper product. Maybe I was just unlucky and got a faulty unit. 3. The pop-up camera is an interesting novelty, but in all honesty is not hugely practical due to the odd position and angle. 4. The laptop isn't pen-enabled; although the laptop has an excellent and responsive touchscreen, none of the styluses I tried, even simple passive styluses, work well with it, and Microsoft's inking functions in Windows and Office aren't therefore accessible. This won't seem much of a loss for some users, but if you do have any hopes for inking and sketching then you should look elsewhere for a machine with active pen support. 5. Finally, I question Huawei's ability to provide prompt service, support and repairs in the UK yet. Devices at this price point really should be backed up with first class support services. Firms like Apple can somewhat justify their high prices by their comprehensive network of support services, but it's hard to say that for Huawei.\nOverall, its a really nice laptop that in many ways exceeds even the very best of the competition, so it is certainly well worth considering. However, Huawei still have a little more to do to make this a truly outstanding device. You certainly won't go badly wrong buying this laptop, but if you aren't in a hurry perhaps it's worth waiting for the next iteration to give Huawei time to iron out the little bugs and more time to build up and prove their UK support services."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is a great laptop that I highly recommend.\nI started using the Matebook X Pro on 20th December 2018 and now that I've used it for just over a month I thought I'd leave a review of what I think of it.\nPrior to buying this I had a 2015 13\" MacBook Pro with i5, 8GB and 256GB SSD.  I couldn't justify paying £2200+ for a new MBP and so did lots of research on what to replace it with.\nI am a photographer and it was important to me that the replacement met my needs of being powerful enough to run Lightroom Classic and Photoshop CC quickly and smoothly; had a screen that was much higher resolution than the 2560x1600 my MBP did; was lightweight and had both USB-C and USB-A ports.  I also wanted to pay less than £2K it.\nIn the i7, 16GB, 512GB version, this Matebook X Pro 13.9 is the perfect laptop for me.  And it cost a lot less than £2K.  I see that is now even cheaper at £100 less than I paid so it's an absolute steal now!\nThe gorgeous 3000 x 2000 3:2 aspect screen shows my photos off brilliantly. It is bright and full of colour. I have a Spyder5Pro monitor calibrator and when I calibrated the screen it was so well set up out of the box that it didn't change by much at all afterwards.\nEditing my photos on the Matebook X Pro works like a dream. Lightoom Classic and Photoshop CC are speedy to use (although perhaps not as fast as I was expecting from the i7 and 16GB spec).  It was a bit fiddly to get Lightroom to recognise the Nvidia graphics card but once I set that up, LR CC is pretty speedy.\nThe 512GB SSD is plenty big enough especially as a 2TB external HDD is only about £60.\nOne thing that others have mentioned is that it comes with a very handy freebie: a Matedock 2 dongle that plugs into the USB-C port and gives you 1 x USB-A, 1 x VGA, 1 x HDMI and 1 x USB-c port. This is brilliant and saved me buying one. It would have been nice to get an SD port too but I solved that by buying this cheap, but excellent, USB-C to SD port dongle: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07GNTFHFH/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1\nI was worried about switching from Mac OS, which I thought was brilliant and so much better than Windows 7, to Windows 10 but I needn't have worried: Windows 10 has caught up and possibly exceeded Mac OS and I don't miss Mac OS at all.  And I certainly don't miss having to find Mac versions of useful utilities that are easily available on Windows.\nOther things I don't miss is the MacBook Pro trackpad. It was the best I'd ever used in 2015 but the Matebook's trackpad is just as good, if not better!  The fingerprint scanner / power button is really responsive and works a treat. The keyboard is really good too.\nThe laptop is very lightweight, battery life is good and the charger is very compact.\nI like the hidden webcam. I haven't used it yet but not having it at the top of the screen means that the screen bezels are really small. In fact they are so small that it took me a while to get used to looking so far up the screen to see the top of the screen!\nTalking of the screen, this brings me to the only negative I can see. And that is the disappointing touchscreen.  Although it works well when selecting things using touch it is really disappointing that it isn't compatible with a smart pen. And that Lightroom Classic and Photoshop CC don't support using the touchscreen to paint or touch up photos. So I don't tend to use the touchscreen much.\nDespite this negative I love using this laptop and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1.0","content":"looks great, but hinge breaks despite careful use. amazingly annoying and disappointing"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Pros:\nKeyboard is one of the best I've used.\nSound quality is immense for a laptop of its size.\n3 by 2 screen resolution and tiny bezel give it an beautiful premium look.\nTrack pad is large and responsive\nFingerprint touch ID response is almost instant\nVery fast processor\nLight, slick, portable design\nCons:\nKeys light up in the dark, however this is uncontrollable and sometimes not responsive enough\nCan get hot if left on charge and running heavy programs\nTrack pad still not as smooth as Apple's Macbook Pro\nWebcam is integrated into the keyboard, which is useful for privacy settings and makes space for the tiny bezel, which I'm not complaining about.

Build quality is good, it's fast with no real lag or delays in anything and it can even handle a bit of light gaming (but manage your expectations - it has no separate graphics chip afterall).\nI had been waiting for this laptop to launch in the UK for a while after many great reviews online - however I was under the impression that it was supposed to have a touch screen and fingerprint reader and mine does not! Both aren't deal breakers since I wouldn't use the touchscreen anyway, but it would have been nice to have the same features as those in other regions.\nLooking though the specs the touchscreen isn't listed on Amazon - which probably means we've got a cut down version here in the UK AND it's more expensive.\nStill great machine and I'm pleased with it."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This laptop just has an unreal screen & an unreal product quality.

The space grey aluminium chassis is subtle, stylish and well engineered; perhaps not quite up to Apple standards but pretty close.  The finger print reader is built into the power button and performs flawlessly - just one press is required to power on and sign in via Windows Hello.\nI purchased maxed-out 16GB i7 model for work and use it for development,  programming and photo editing.  Performance is excellent and I rarely have the performance slider set to maximum.  The screen is bright, vibrant and I really like the 3:2 aspect ratio which means less scrolling.\nThere are a few minor negatives\n1.  The price of the 16GB model is significantly higher than the 8GB.  £200 is a lot of money for an extra 8GB RAM but it isn't upgradeable.\n2.  The 16GB top of the range model only comes with Windows 10 Home but the mid-level model comes with Pro.  This is bizarre and slightly annoying - I think a laptop costing this much should come with the Pro edition.  I paid for an upgrade key.\n3. The bundled dock is useless as it has no ethernet port.\n4.  The keyboard is backlit but the backlighting times out after a few seconds and will only come on again with a keypress.  This is annoying when working in dim lighting and can't be changed.\n5.  No active pen support for the screen.\n6. The protective glass over the screen is highly reflective,  typical for a touch screen, but difficult to work on outdoors.\nOverall, an excellent design and a delight to use."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Good 13 inch ultrabook.

Do not remove it if you want to use Huawei Share. If you don't have a Huawei phone or don't care about Huawei Share then you can peel it off.\nIgnore the part where it says \"The i7 variant comes with NVIDIA GeForce MX150, perfect for casual gaming and photo editing.\" The UK i7 model does NOT have the nVidia MX150 and you only get the stock Intel integrated graphics. The MX150 GPU is only present in models in other countries."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"lovely keyboard, starts up fast, fingerprint id in the power on button is genius. 2 usb c and normal usb are great and came with an adapter hub for hdmi and another usb c and usb standard which I thought was a nice touch.

Screen is very nice. I have only had about 6 weeks so hopefully will stay good. Battery life thus far is excellent - 10 hours no problem. Bought on the back of excellent reviews and would happily recommend it. Huawei clearly have Dell and Apple in their sites and, if I  was them, I would be worried. Very nicely packaged too creating an excellent 1st impression even before you have it out the box."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I actually ordered the i5 256SSD configuration but despite clearly showing as being in stock I wasn't given a shipping date after inquiring I was said it was being investigated which is outrageous as when the item isn't available for dispatch there's a notice saying currently Unavailable we'll email you when we have it but no it's there maybe know it's in stock. So because I'm going overseas in 3 weeks I needed a decent ultrabook after returning the disappointing HP Envy 13,3 AMD Ryzen 7 so I was literally \"forced\" to choose the i7-855OU configuration when I'd read in a few reviews that the benchmarks for both models are basically equall because of processor throttling on the i7 855OU which I can see with medium heavy work it heats up to throttling levels worse even than the HP. So buy the i5 256SSD you'll get the same performance and it has the same Nvidea MX150 2GB and you wont have to deal with throttling. The screen is the best thing this thing has, the ridiculous camera and lack of sports the worse it comes with an adapter for hdmi USB 3.1 but I bought one with an micro sd and 4 usb and 1 hdmi port. Its aesthetically pleasing and well built but it's a Huawei so even with all the rave reviews I've read in just about every English speaking PC site you still pray nothing goes wrong. For the gamers I was suprised I played Battlefield 4 on 1920×1080 on ultra settings and Battlefield Hardline also on 1920x1080 high settings so if you want to to dabble in a bit of gaming you could do worse after all it's not made for that. But for my needs Photo editing it's more than enough I'm just scared how it will perform in 36c and 90% humidity but AC will hopefully keep it from melting. Like I mentioned I went for it because of the reviews. The i7-855OU 16G Ram 512SSD was available for €60 less even with duty from Amazon US but the warranty was just valid in the US. Why doesn't Amazon give us access to that configuration at the same price? The man is making $235.000 a minute but cant lower the prices."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I won’t add anymore to what has been said except to reiterate what a fantastic laptop this is. I wasn’t sure if the i7 8GB Ram and 512GB HD actually did come with Windows 10 Pro as there is conflicting information and even Huawei UK suggest it is Windows 10 Home. I can confirm it does come with the Pro version which was important to be as it has Bitlocker whole disk encryption. When Bitlocker is enabled the fingerprint / on switch works seamlessly to turn on and log into windows. Also, it comes with a UK keyboard (the pictures show a US keyboard) with a double height return key. Finally, the charger is quite small with a UK plug with the earth pin sliding down to reduce height for storage."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Having only had this for a few days it's impossible to give an in-depth review however overall it's certainly a nice laptop: but it's a nice laptop horribly marred by a ridiculous placement of the webcam. Popping up in the function key row results in a ridiculous up-the-nose viewpoint. I can't imagine any context in which this would be sensible, much less desirable.\nI just ordered an external webcam - which makes this laptop cost £30 more than the nominal price.\nIf it wasn't for the fact that this kind of ludicrous design concept so frequently makes it into production it would be incomprehensible.\nDays later...\nOverall I'm very happy with it but there's another very annoying - if minor - defect. The battery level indications vary crazily in terms of the estimated time available. Sometimes (like now) with 68% of the battery left the estimated life reads as > 9hrs, which is nonsense. At other times a similar level will indicate an estimated 2 hrs - with an almost identical load, ie a few browser tabs and a standard set of utility apps running. Such nonsensical variation in the indications makes them completely worthless.\neven later\nThe stupid battery reporting continues. In the hope of fixing this I reluctantly decided to install the Huawei maintenance utility. Reading the EULA it appears that I now have a member of the People's Liberation Army resident in my home. It installed about five driver updates (why doesn't the MS update recognise these?) but seems to have no effect on the nonsensical battery reporting.\nAnyway, given that almost every server made in China (ie almost all of them, including those used by all the major corporations, military and intelligence services worldwide) contains a concealed back door disguised  as an innocuous passive component, why should I object to providing the Chinese government with my pitifully uninteresting data?"},{"rating":"2.0","content":"This product did not have a nVidia graphics chipset as detailed in the product information for this model; therefore this item was returned.\nFrom my brief time I had this laptop I loved the screen, the minimalist bezel and high-definition panel was crystal clear and great value for money.\nThe unit appeared to be very fast, booting up via SSD quickly and responding well to both keyboard and touchscreen.

I poured over reviews, watched countless YouTube videos and even went as far as venturing in to shops to see them. On that last point, alas I was only able to physically see the Dell.\nAfter looking at the spec's of each and their costs relative to each other, I eventually took a punt on the Huawei - the discrete graphics and 3000x2000 resolution being two key factors. It is, quite simply, a stunning laptop. No picture you have seen or video you have watched will do justice to its subtle looks. They will do nothing to convey the tactile feel of its aluminium body, its lightness, how good the keyboard is, how good the speakers are, how responsive the trackpad is or how well the finger sensor in the power button works. I'll concede that the webcam positioning renders it pretty much useless but I don't need or use a webcam so that wasn't an issue. Plus, I'd rather have the almost bezel-free screen that not having a webcam in the usual position allows. The screen, by the way, is sensational - razor sharp and bright enough that I'm yet to encounter a situation whereby I can't see what's displayed as clearly as I want to. A couple of reviews I read mentioned the logo on the outside of the lid and seemed to suggest it was too large. I'm not sure if there's a slight whiff of badge snobbery here, perhaps tinged with embarrassment but pay this particular criticism no mind.\nHad I bought the Dell, I'm sure I would have been happy with it but it's a bit too much like a work laptop for me. The Lenovo came a close second but it was slightly more expensive for a slightly lesser specification - and it would have taken over two weeks to arrive. No-one's that patient - are they?\nSo the Huawei won and it won well. It's perfect - buy one!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Everything about this laptop is A+. Bright and dynamic UHD screen.

I suggest googling \"Matebook X Pro Rattle\" to find further reports from owners having issues with the track pad. I first noticed something was wrong when I noticed that there was a small amount of movement when depressing the track pad before it responded with feedback and the obvious click. This then degraded further to the point that the track pad became extremely spongy and the audible clicking sound had pretty much disappeared altogether."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I have not ever bought any product from huawei because i would think that apple and samsung are the best brands for either phones or laptops. I have not tried the phones of huawei but i can tell you something for sure that this laptop is the best laptop that i could ever bought in my opinion. Highly recommanded from me !!!"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"This is an excellent laptop.\nThe only aspect of it which doesn't work for me is the fingerprint recognition, which I have now abandoned\nin favour of a PIN..\nRecently, after a systems update, I have been  harassed by Cortana.\nThere used to be an on/off switch for this malfunction. Microsoft have sneakily removed it.\nNone of which is a fault of the laptop, of course, but perhaps the makers can come up with a workaround?"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Having used Apple Macbook Pro, and various laptops (e.g. Lenovo, Toshiba) before, this is the first time buying a laptop from Huawei due to the various great reviews that can be found online, including by professional technology sites.\nFirst impression is that this is a very stylish looking laptop with its colour (grey) akin to the Apple MacBook’s. The aluminium unibody coupled with its slimness and lightweight (and apparently lighter than Macbook Air) makes this laptop at the top end in terms of design. It has a full size keyboard and backlit (like MacBook), which is comfy to type on; the large trackpad is a bit wide to my liking, and may get a bit used to it.\nThe other selling points for me including the fingerprint sensor, which means this laptop can be turned on and signed in with a single touch, as well as the touch screen display - making the experience synonymous to using a high end mobile phone. Another unique feature of the laptop includes impressive screen to body ratio of 91 percent, unlike most of the laptops on the market. Will have to use it more for high definition videos to appreciate the experience of the display. Obviously, since I will use this a lot while on travel, its long battery life (claimed to be up to 12 hours) is a selling point, but I haven’t fully tested it\nThe only minor nag for me would be the pop-up camera -  while innovatively designed to be hidden discretely on the keyboard and pops up only when it is needed, unfortunately its positioning means it is quite a challenge to get a normal view of one’s face unless the laptop is held or tilted at certain angle. Overall, a good solid laptop, and its premium price make it at the high end of the market for laptops"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"There is not much to say, I simply love this laptop. I use the laptop mainly for work\nThe power button with the integrated fingerprint scanner is absolutely brilliant! I just press the button and I am logged into windows in 6-7 seconds, ready to start working.\nThe screen is the best I have seen so far.\nThere are two usb-c connectors and both can be used for charging or to connect external monitors.\nThe performance is top of the class."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Looks and feels like an expenses piece of kit, especially with a carbon fibre dbrand skin on top. Performance is great, no bloatware, port variety is adequate. Wish there was an SD reader but I can use a USB adapter for that. Video camera view is awkwardly positioned but I don't think I'll ever use it. Has a nice weight to it, not the lightest but its light enough. The screen is amazing 3k resolution and a joy to use but not as a tablet of course. This is not what this laptop is made for.\nThere are a couple of issues though with the track pad. Although it's nice and big, it interferes with typing, so I find that my typing is often interrupted because my palm accidentally hit the trackpad. Really annoying. Also, there is a bit of rattle in the trackpad which makes using it slightly annoying. Also the scrolling smoothness and speed is not as good as Apple's but I guess this is a Microsoft driver issue that needs to be sorted out.\nBesides that I'm very happy with it. It's a head Turner and I can attach my external GPU for some heavy gaming too."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"It's a perfect little laptop for all my needs. Quick, good looking, touchscreen and light. Slightly upset that it doesn't have 16gb RAM as the American version does, however, it still powers through any task with ease."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"The UK model KPL - W00D / 53010FHS does not have a touch screen. After looking at many product reviews online of the Huawei Matebook D 14 (AMD Ryzen), I was under the impression that Huawei Matebook D 14 uniformly has the touch screen feature. However, after receiving the product and contacting customer service, it is clear that Huawei in fact released different versions of this product and features differed in different parts of the world. If you are purchasing this product or any other product from Huawei from the UK, please be aware that there are variations in the model. I recommend double check with seller before you purchase.\nOther than that, it is a great laptop. Great specs, great appearance, good speed, though it got a little warm every now and then, but this is a really good buy."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"think apple but cheaper and in many ways better. the super fast charging and lack of fan noise is amazing. i have had many mac's over the years and this laptop far out preforms them. the design is lovely the finger print reader so far has worked every time. the battery life is amazing and the overall speed of the laptop is excellent."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"While it has a great screen and battery life, this laptop has a bad thermal management system and performs worse than a tablet. While the i7-8550U model can turbo boost to 4.00 GHz, it very quickly (20+ seconds) lowers its frequency to base clocks (1.80 GHz) and after another 30 seconds or so thermal throttles below the processor base frequency. This renders the upgrade to i7-8550U useless as it performs on par or worse than the cheaper i5-8250U model. The performed tests do not include the usage of the dedicated MX150 graphics card, which if in use would reduce the times it takes for the laptop to reach thermal throttled state (and be really slow) even further. There is another well known manufacture process issues involving the track-pad that makes it unstable and rattling which can be annoying considering the price tag. Forgot to mention, the display hinge got very loose after a few weeks to the point that the display closes itself if it is not open to 80 degrees or more."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I am very impressed with the speed of this laptop. From being powered off to being logged in and google up infront of me, it takes around 5-6 seconds. I hold my finger down on the power button and whilst it boots up it reads my fingerprint and logs me in. The screen is stunning and at 100% brightness is unbelievably bright! It comes with an adapter so you can use external monitors and provides an extra usb port. Keyboard is very satisfying to type on.
