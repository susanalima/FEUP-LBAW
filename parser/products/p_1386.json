You can do this via Control Panel - Devices."},{"q":"How do I replace one of these with an identical new one? Do I need to uninstall the old one first? Cos new one is much slower and can't control it.","a":"Here is a link with step by step instuctions for Windows;"},{"q":"will this mouse work with my new Asus Vivobook?. thank you.","a":"Yes it will, there is a separate wireless plug that you plug into your USB and your mouse connects to that.

Apparently some clowns in Logitech decided to make fundamental changes to the product and call it exactly the same MK330.  They could't even bother to version it!"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Batteries are included, so I was able to get started straight away and installation on a Win7 PC was as simple as plugging in the tiny USB dongle and waiting a minute whilst the drivers updated. The keyboard is nice and light but I find the mouse too small for my hand - it's a good deal smaller than a conventional, wired, home computer mouse which, for most domestic/home office use, is a little uncomfortable.\nYou'll need to download the Logitech Setpoint software if you want to be able to identify Num Lock and Caps Lock status (via on-screen overlay), as the keyboard features no status indicators, presumably to extend battery life. The software also enables some keyboard shortcut and mouse customisation, which you may appreciate."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I received this combo set from Amazon EU three days before forecast, so that was a nice surprise. And so far, it has lived up to its promise. I bought it to replace a corded keyboard which had become increasingly unreliable & the fact that it's cordless is a surprising bonus.\nThe keys are noticeably quieter than the previous one, the very large backspace ( & mysteriously, another spare one on the top right, in case you forget where the main one is, presumably) & delete keys are also nice, as I make a lot of typos as I type quite fast. It also has the dinky little fold-out feet at the back to angle it, with rubber bumpers on the lower bit, so it doesn't slide about on the desktop & comes with batteries pre-installed.\nIt has a predominantly matte surface, so not the dust & fingerprint magnet my previous one was. The calculator key is very useful, as are the alternate function keys, actuated by pushing the blue 'fn' key. One slight niggle is that the silver media keys at the top don't have very distinct symbols on them, making it slightly difficult to see their function. One of these completely shuts down your pc with one button press: very handy.\nOddly, it doesn't have Caps Lock or Num Lock leds, but a small screen advice notice appears when you activate them, & who doesn't always have Num Lock On?\nThe quiet & discrete action of the keys is also very positive for a cheap membrane keyboard (as opposed to the more expensive mechanical ones) & overall & it's quite a bit smaller dimension-wise than the monstrous gaming keyboard it's replaced. The handy thing about having a cordless keyboard is that you can just pick it up & place it aside if you actually feel the need to write something on paper on your desktop, or eat a meal. OK, I was joking about that last bit, as I'm not that desperate or slobbish & I have a table in the dining room to eat meals from. But you know what I mean. Quickly frees up deskspace.\nIt claims very long battery life but I haven't had it long enough to test the 24 month claim. Anyway, for the particularly frugal, it has an on/off switch underneath. I'm very pleased with it, & at the current Amazon price, it's a winner by my standards.\nNow, the mouse......\nI didn't need another mouse as I have an ancient cordless Logitech M510 using a similar tiny USB dongle in one of the pc's front USB ports, so expected it to work immediately, along with the keyboard, as it's got the Logitech Unifying software previously installed. Alas, the new (tiny) dongle, which looks identical to my old one, didn't work with my old M510, which is perfectly weighted, big, tall, sophisticated (much like me) & perfectly suited to my hand & loads better than the cordless M215 which comes bundled with this combo.\nCompared to the M215 my old M510 is a Rolls Royce, so I was momentarily dispirited.\nThe M215 which comes bundled is quite small, has no left-hand back/forward browser buttons, no left/right scroll function on the scroll wheel, & is, if I put it delicately, is more suitable for a smaller female hand than mine & is much less sophisticated than the M510 & makes a scratchy noise on my Fellowes gel-pad mouse mat, which the M510 doesn't. It's a piece of c**p frankly. But OK for a lady or a dwarf. Not a Man's Mouse.\nBUT.......\nI got on the Logitech site/support  & updated the Unifying Software, switched off the 510 then on again & Bingo! It instantly recognised it & worked, as the Unifying software recognised the 510 after specifying it in the simple menu. You can run up to six Logitech unifying peripherals from the same dongle, so that might be helpful to people who have other cherished Logitech input products like me. However, my M510 cost more than this keyboard/mouse combo combined.\nThe supplied M215 might be small & light so more suitable for use with a laptop & at least I've got a spare mouse in case my M510 goes kaput (unlikely).\nAll in all, 5 stars for the keyboard, at its price point, but missed 5 stars due to the patheticness of the mouse in this combo. But if you're not too fussy about mice, disregard this.\nAll in all, typical Logitech quality & build, & for a membrane keyboard, this is good enough for me. Recommended."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I have just received my replacement for the first one I bought last week. This was returned (or will be as soon as the courier arrives - now five days)- anyway the reason I am returning the first one is because when it is \"switched on\" - tiny switch on the base of the \"mouse\", the light does not light up, therefore due to poor eyesight and not being able to see clearly the \"on/off\" button on the base, I don't know if the mouse is actually on or off. My wife uses a \"Microsoft\" wireless mouse on her laptop and has had the same one for years without any problem - so am I doing something wrong - should it light up to show on or off as does the \"Microsoft\" mouse. Otherwise, it was easy to plug in, works straight away, and \"feels\" ok in the hand.

I downloaded the Logitech software for this mouse but it made no difference.

Windows 8 found the driver for it so I didn't even have to install it myself.  It works perfectly and I like the \"hot keys\" which are configured in Windows 8 to give you quick access to browser, mail. mucis player etc.  I like the key which minimises all the Windows at once which is suprisingly useful.  You can also mute the speakers with one of the keys and instantly reduce the volume with another - nice if someone comes into the room and want to say something to you.\nThe keyboard is nice and quiet - which I think is a great benefit over earlier versions.  The wifi dongle  is tiny - a great improvement also.\nThe mouse could be bigger - it's about 20% smaller than my previous Logitech combo.

Any comments from you Logitech?"},{"rating":"1.0","content":"This worked like a mouse for about 3 weeks, now the cursor flies all over my screen, jumping from one side to the other. I have changed the battery 3 times, no change. This is not a setting, not a speed of travel adjustment, this is hyperspace disappear from one location and just appear in another, it makes the mouse unusable, it means you have to buy another mouse, and this time not Logitech!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I have had several iterations of this product over the years and I am very pleased with this one which I bought to go with a new Windows 8 Desktop computer.  Windows 8 found the driver for it so I didn't even have to install it myself.  It works perfectly and I like the \"hot keys\" which are configured in Windows 8 to give you quick access to browser, mail. mucis player etc.  I like the key which minimises all the Windows at once which is suprisingly useful.  You can also mute the speakers with one of the keys and instantly reduce the volume with another - nice if someone comes into the room and want to say something to you.\nThe keyboard is nice and quiet - which I think is a great benefit over earlier versions.  The wifi dongle  is tiny - a great improvement also.\nThe mouse could be bigger - it's about 20% smaller than my previous Logitech combo. I've got used to it, but would still prefer a larger mouse, but it's not a big deal to me and I have no problem awarding this combo 5 stars."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"This is a good standard-sized UK-layout keyboard with a quite light touch to the keys.  The Logitech plug-and-play USB dongle means that set-up simply takes care of itself.  There are even batteries already in the keyboard and mouse, so that all you need to do is pull out the insulating plastic strips and flick the switches on these devices to the \"on\" position.\nI will try to be more careful with this mouse.  I sent the last one flying through the air, hitting a furniture leg - quite an expensive accident.  This new mouse also feels as though it would not survive such a traumatic accident."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"This very nice keyboard has a big problem for anyone who is constantly cutting and pasting things (which is most people).  The keys for Delete and Insert, normally place one above the other on the right hand side, and here replaced by a single big Delete key.  I cannot imagine why.  and the Insert button is moved to where you would expect Print Screen to be in the same row as the F keys.  If you have a habit of knowing the keyboard layout and your fingers simply go to the right place when you want to insert, then this keyboard will give you endless trouble.\nI threw it away and bought the cheaper and better M270. ."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Probably the worst keyboard and mouse set I've ever owned.\nKeyboard constantly goes to sleep, you have to beat it to get any life (Even with new batteries, receiver next to unit etc)\nMy neighbour at our offices has the same one and shows the same isses. This is how they get 24 month life, because 20 of those months its sleeping!\nI've had this for over a year to try get my monies worth, but enough is enough - trading for a microsoft set."}],"pictures":"\ndata:image/jpeg;base64,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
