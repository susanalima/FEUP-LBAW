{"name":"Trust 21949 Ziva Optical Wireless Mouse for Computer and Laptop, 1200-1800 DPI, Black","brand":"Trust","weight":"118 g","model":"21949","color":"Black","release_date":"1 Sept. 2017","price":"£5.99","stock":138,"q_a":[{"q":"Does this mouse have a light underneath it that lights up when plugged into a usb port?","a":"The mouse I am using is a Samsung MOARUOA, This has an infra-red light under the body, if this is the same as the one you are asking about. Most mice have either a ball or infra-red pickup to indicate that the mouse has been moved."},{"q":"Does the mouse work on a black surface?","a":"Yes any surface"},{"q":"does this fit USB1?","a":"Yes it does"},{"q":"Does this mouse really have a \"usb-c connection \" as stated on the webpage?     thanks.","a":"No it does not. I do not know why my review is here for this item. I didn’t review this mouse. I reviewed a different one that is wireless."},{"q":"Can you press the wheel as another button...?","a":"Cant help haven't received it yet"},{"q":"will this work on windows 10?","a":"Yes it will work on windows 10"},{"q":"Will it work on iMac","a":"I use it on Windows I'm afraid, don't know about an imac"},{"q":"Is this mouse silent or do the side buttons for page changing make a click noise like an on off switch? thank you","a":"Hello, the side buttons do make a clicking noise."},{"q":"will this work on windows 7","a":"It sure will."},{"q":"Does this mouse have a light underneath it that lights up when plugged into a usb port?","a":"Yes it does have a red light which is visible from the underside only. I know that some computer mouse are illuminated through to the upper side but not this one. I have now had this Trust 16591 optical wired mouse for at least 3 years and it gets used daily without any problems."}],"reviews":[{"rating":"4.0","content":"I was after a Trust mouse as it offers a 2 year warranty and my previous wireless mouse died after ... 23 months!\nMake no mistake, this is one cheap looking and cheap feeling mouse with thin plastics but it does everything that it says on the tin. Despite the overly fussy design, it handles well and is comfortable for several hours use. The buttons are nice and clicky and the sides have pimpled rubberised panels for extra grip. There's an additional DPI button to change the sensitivity and tracking but this is a soft touch button and I've only used it a few times (made little to no difference).\nWhat's much better is the scrolling wheel which is both ratcheted and etched so your finger won't slip. You can also click it for a middle button action. Underneath the Trust Ziva, there is a tiny on / off switch which needs a fingernail to operate, and a battery compartment with space to stow the wireless receiver so you won't lose it. There are several nifty auto-off features which work very well; after several minutes of inactivity, the mouse will go into sleep mode and can be woken up with a click; disconnecting the wireless receiver also puts the mouse to sleep; and for good measure you can always turn it off manually using the switch. With daily use, the batteries have lasted just under 3 months which is poor compared to other mice that advertise anything up to 18 months of battery life, but then again, it's only a fiver to begin with. It might also just be the batteries that came with the mouse were not fully charged.\nUsing the Trust Ziva is great, I've not had any dropouts or erratic cursors like with other wireless mouses (mice? meeses?) and the tracking is nice and smooth with accuracy when you need it coupled with sufficient ergonomics and a nicely sculpted design to minimise fatigue.\nWhat's not so good however is the battery compartment of the Trust Ziva. It's so flimsy and cheap that you're scared to even sneeze in case the battery door falls off. If you end up dropping your mouse, I wouldn't expect it to survive a drop of more than 30cm. Added to that is the stupid way in which the batteries have been arranged so they are stacked on top of one another. The top battery has a large gap to one side and is only held in place by the battery compartment lid so when you take this off, there's a 50% chance the top battery will slip out of position as there's nothing there to hold it in.\nI also don't like the side buttons to move backwards and forwards whilst browsing so it's a shame these can't be disabled. Other than Gamers, I don't actually know anyone who uses more than the standard 2 buttons and scroll wheel of a mouse and accidently hitting these when browsing can be  pain.\nTo summarise then, this compact mouse looks and feels like a fiver but does everything advertised with a few extra features like the auto power off. The 2 year warranty from a company that won't disappear overnight is a bonus. It comes retail packed with batteries and for a fiver is a bargain."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Ordered - delivered next day - great!  Didn't work - laptop recognised it, and said it was working, but move mouse around and click and nothing happened.  So I requested replacement - which also arrived next day, and also didn't work - same issue.  Technical support was a waste of time.  No instructions with the product just in case I had done something wrong - but with \"put batteries in and plug receiver into computer\" how hard can it be?  Tried both in three different computers with no joy.  Sent both back and requested a refund (job in itself as it was a labelless return with a QR code - how am I supposed to show that to the PO when I have a computer and not a smart phone - so was not so labelless), and then ordered a Seenda wireless mouse, which also arrived next day - plugged in and joy of joy's worked perfectly!  Don't waste your time on this item only to have to return it and order a different one."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"A great average sized 2nd mouse, I use it all the time with my laptop, it has everything you need to make it more than just a standard mouse and for the price you really can not go wrong. I have had lots of trust pc products over the years without any problems."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Did its job. Bought as a backup for my Mac mouse which has an annoying habit of losing its connection to my computer, thus making it difficult for me to remedy as can't use mouse to move cursor. Only used a couple of times but works well enough for the price, and obviously works with a Mac."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is a perfect mouse for everyday use. It is fantastic value for money. It hasn't problems on any surface: tables, clothes, walls, ... I didn't try only on ceiling but who knows. I tried with several OS: Linux Mint, Ubuntu, Windows 10, 7, Server 2016 and it works perfectly on every. I've had a problem only with a lace tablecloth because the button for power on/off was hooked. If you're not active few minutes, the mouse go to sleep mode. This is a great feature and if you need it again, you need to click a button. It is very quiet what is perfect for a night work."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"One of my favourite computer mouses (mice?), purely for how reliable and basic it is in comparison to all the cheap 15-button gaming versions you find online. Just plug it in and it works, lovely click feel and sound, unfaltering scroll wheel, fits nicely in the hand. For a higher price you can get one a bit more comfortable, quieter, more buttons, but if you want a basic mouse this is your best shot."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"One star only because I can't put zero - as with many other reviewers, this mouse simply does not work. Plugged dongle in, recognized by windows 7 in device manger with no errors, but mouse pointer will not move!  rebooted, tried on a second PC, no difference. Supplied with no instructions or drivers, support on manufacturers website is a waste of time. Reported to amazon for exchange, they said don't bother send it back, we will send another - guess what? When that one came exactly the same result. Sent the lot back now for refund."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"It looked the part - just didn't work.  The red LED came on at the bottom, but it didn't move the mouse pointer.  (I tried it on two PCs, in the same port as two working mice.)"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Feels very cheap in the hand, batteries seem to shake about inside and have needed re-seating a few times. Overall I guess you get what you pay for.  I also use a logitech keyboard mouse wireless combo which was a similar price point but solid quality"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"It was only when I unpackaged this mouse that I realised I hadn't actually checked to see if it would work with a Mac. The box, and I think the specification here, only mention Windows but it does work thankfully. I just plugged it in and, hey presto, it does what a mouse should. I bought this because although I have a Macbook Pro, I often use it plugged into a second monitor. I have an Apple Keyboard but no Apple mouse or additional track pad. The mouse I was using previously is wireless, which is fine but not when the batteries die! I don't really tend to have batteries for anything else anymore so once they die, I am mouseless. This mouse is perfect, and excellent value for money."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I was after a Trust mouse as it offers a 2 year warranty and my previous wireless mouse died after ... 23 months!\nMake no mistake, this is one cheap looking and cheap feeling mouse with thin plastics but it does everything that it says on the tin.
