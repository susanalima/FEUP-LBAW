Logitech have changed the design - it is very similar but not the same. I have included a pic. I bought this because the layout was identical to my MacBook. Not any more! What a shame. Still a good keyboard, but not quite the gem I hoped it would be. In its favour - a LOT cheaper than the mac keyboard! I'm going to give it a go.\nIn summary: This is a great PC bluetooth keyboard that is also OK for mac.\n* The enter key is now bigger. Not a major issue - its a bigger target than on the MacBook! The cost has been to displace the back slash key to the row below. Not a commonly used key for me.\n* The key to the left of the number 1 is now the same as a PC keyboard and not a mac keyboard. For a mac it outputs § - not sure of the purpose of that.\n* The key that was previously there has been moved to the left of the Z key. That key also now being like a PC keyboard. Make it much more difficult to toggle when used with cmd.\n* The result of that move is to have the shift key on the left to shrink. Again - more typical of PC keyboard.\n* (mac) option+3 = # (this is not printed on the keyboard.\n+ Really well made. Much like all of the Logitech bluetooth keyboards I have encountered.\n+ The \"del\" works like a PC del key - for a mac user that is very welcome.\n+ Great rubber feet.\n+ Bluetooth pairing is painless - unlike the previous Logitech keyboard that I owned.\n+ Switching works REALLY well between my apple devices.\n+ Nice key action.\n- The circular keys take a little getting used to but I got there in the end. Still not 100% convinced by them.\n- The greyed out mac commands on shared function keys are almost invisible.\n- The power key on the left hand side rattles if you knock it. It is the loudest sound on this keyboard. I tend to rest my little finger there - so I do knock it from time to time. It's a minor thing.\n- No light on caps lock. It doesn't activate the MacBook's caps lock light either. But, again, a minor irritation.\n- That small left shift key."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"While I love my Apple Magic keyboard very much, it has one major shortcoming.\nWhenever I want to use it with other devices, I have to disconnect from the previous device it is connected.\nThis can be done but is very time consuming.\nI am so delighted to find K380 which can be connected to up to 3 devices at the same time.\nThree buttons on the left corner of the keyboard quickly changes the device it connects.\nKey spacing and pressure is almost as same as Magic keyboard, which is great for people with small hands like myself.\nThe only difference is the angle. It is more flat than Magic keyboard.\nI overcome this flatness by gluing a small felt pad for the furniture (see attached photoes).\nI actually did the same thing for the Logitech touchpad T650 to make it same angle as Magic trackpad.\nIt worked great!\nThe added bonus was the extra friction from the felt pad gives more stability.\nNow I can leave my Magic keyboard always attached to my main machine, while K380 can be used on all other devices (two tablets and one smartphone)."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Probably one of the best, wireless keyboards I have used thus far. Although Logitech K380 is slightly more expensive than many other similar devices available on amazon, I found the Logitech K380 quality, lack of lag and ability to swiftly re-establish connection making it distinctly superior to the various other brands I have tried this far (Literally tried 7 other brands, each eventually displaying various issues including intermittent connection problems so were all evidently returned).\nI am currently using this keyboard with my Macbook Pro 13 Retina (Mid 2014 model) under both OSX and Windows 7 (Bootcamp). The keyboard displays the ability to pair with 3 different bluetooth devices making it easy to switch between them using a simple press of either F1, F2 or F3 (buttons are yellow in the image).\nI initially purchased the keyboard when writing up my final year dissertation project and needed a device that was as good and fast as the native built in keyboard on my macbook (with ofcourse lacking cables) allowing my macbook to be linked with an external monitor and for me to sit back in a relaxed position to type. The Logitech K380 lived up to my expectations.\nPros:\n- Displays a high quality, well built feel.\n- Easy to setup and use.\n- Relatively small overall size but with a standard keyboard layout (similar to a macbook pro)\n- Has the ability to connect and control up to 3 different bluetooth devices.\n- Long battery life – Batteries are included! (Logitech claims up to 2 years – however I can confirm with high use, batteries still going strong after 6 months of use).\n- Keyboard has built in sleep feature to save on power and appears to re-establish connection within 2-3 seconds.\nCons:\n- Relatively more expensive than several other similar devices.\n- Battery powered device (many other brands are now provide the ability to recharge the device).\n- Keys are circular and do take a little bit of getting used to."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I have never left a product review on anything before (I find them extremely tedious). But this keyboard is absolutely fantastic.\nI just received it, pulled the tab on the back (batteries were included) and paired it to my Windows 10 PC, my MacBook Pro and my iPhone (which i'm typing this review on, whilst the phone is in a charging dock! - amazingly useful. Took a total of 5 minutes.\nPros:\n- Great size in a medium/small desk setting. I have average sized hands and it's easy to speed type on.\n- The keys have a satisfying conviction, and no wobble - so no mistyping at all.\n- I can easily switch in a second between 3 devices. Easy to mix work and personal gadget typing quickly.\n- Dual OS works flawlessly.\n- Zero lag on either W10 or OSX.\n- Solid weight + rubber feet, this thing won't budge easily.\n- All the function keys work on your phone (music play/pause/volume & Ringer level)\nCons:\n- Not the most stylish keyboard, but the Matte grey is a nice colour if you have other 'Space Grey' items.\nThere is absolutely no way the Apple Magic Keyboard should be 3x the cost of this. You'd be a bit of a fool not to buy this, especially if you're looking for productivity over style."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I use an Apple Mac and a PC and was getting fed up switching between keyboards which took up considerable room on my desk.This allows me to swap between the two instantaneously. There is a seconds delay in switching between devices but little more - occasionally if I switch and type fast into the new device it misses a few characters, but a little patience and it will work perfectly.\nMy only gripe is that the choice of device is made using the first 3 function keys, which also have uses in an audio editing programme I use regularly. The button presses to access the F1-F3 functions are annoyingly cumbersome when trying to work fast - but it is a minor inconvenience.\nAs a design suggestion for the Mark2 version - I would suggest that Logitech leave the tiny LED light - above the button which denotes which device you are connected to - permanently on otherwise it is easy to forget and start typing into the wrong device.  The lights currently turn on when you select the new device but then turn off after 5 seconds.\nBattery life seems good too - I'm on my first set and use this for 4-5 hours daily when in my home office - and that's after more than 2 months."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"This is rather expensive for a bluetooth keyboard, but I have had a succession of keyboards over the years to try to link with my iPad and my MacBook, and each one has failed me at an awkward time, so i thought I'd bite the bullet and get a Logitech one. I bought this particular keyboard because of the facility to pair with 3 devices and switch the keyboard between them by pressing a button, thereby eliminating the need to carry multiple keyboards with me when I travel.\nDelivery was prompt and the keyboard arrived intact and well-packaged.\nThe keyboard has a satisfying weight and solid feel to it. Unlike some of the cheaper models I've bought in the past. Pairing with each of my devices was a breeze, and switching between them is fiendishly easy! it has \"dual keys\" which recognise the device you are paired with and functions accordingly (the grey symbols relate to Apple, the white to Microsoft/Android I believe). I've had no issues with this. The size of the keyboard, spacing of keys etc is compact, but not cramped. I have yet to have an issue mis-hitting keys because of their location.\nit is on the pricey side, and I would have given it an even higher rating if it came with its own sleeve or cover (hence the 4, not 5 stars), however, my first impressions (I've only had it a few days) are that it will give me many years of service.\nThis keyboard is probably the best I've bought."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"My daughter has the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1-inch (2014 edition) tablet with which she uses 'gesture typing' with the tablets Google keyboard touchscreen app (where you slide from character to character and lift up when the words complete). Plus she has the Note tablet's bespoke \n for rapid handwritten note-taking and tablet control. And she does type & write tablet words faster than I can type with this Logitech K380 keyboard. However she did get this Logitech K380 keyboard in \n to try with her 10\" tablet and we were both quite impressed with it. The keyboard works with PC's as well, which can be handy as a remote if a Bluetooth enabled laptop is playing a movie in the distance. So when I purchased my large 13\" \n tablet I decided that this K380 keyboard would be a perfect functional compliment to the 13\" screen tablet (and it is - it also looks good in dark grey and it was a few pounds cheaper than the blue coloured K380 as well). The keyboard was easily paired with my Yoga 2 Tablet, the Galaxy Note 10.1 and my Nexus 7 tablet (you can pair and remember three devices).  Once paired the keyboard just works when the tablet comes on - and that was surprisingly useful if like my daughter you have a long complicated password for your login screen (the alternative old style telephone keypad keyboard being particularly horrible to use). I didn't think the lack of an inbuilt stand for the tablet was a problem as all our tablets have built in stands integrated into their official tablet cases or the tablet itself in the case of my Yoga 2 Pro. There's no keyboard manual included but all the details (e.g. keyboard shortcuts) are on Logitech's website as the 'setup guide'.\nIn use this K380 keyboard is naturally great for Office and internet chores, and in particular when editing number and text in Excel type spreadsheets within our Pro Office Suite Android app or editing text when you have the up/down left/right arrows and forward-delete. Plus of course it gives you a better view of the document screen when typing and editing a lot of text, as you don't need the Android keyboard app overlaid on half of the screen. There's eight double key shortcuts, e.g. Fn+C is copy, Fn+V is paste and Fn+X is cut. The top keys also function as media player controls where you can change track, adjust volume and mute sound at the touch of a button (sound control is the most useful as it means you don't have to fumble with the tablet to press the volume control buttons). There's also keys for menu, pause play, switch apps, home, and delete. And there's the standard keyboard keys for things like tab, return, back-delete, shift, and cntrl, plus the normal four arrow directional keys. Both our tablets and my daughter's Honor 6 smartphone run Android 4 (KitKat) and this keyboard works with Android 3 and above. There's no click when you use the keyboard so it'll be OK in lectures and meetings, although there is a slight tapping noise as you hit each key. The 'laptop style' keyboard tile keys are fine with my large male hands and the keys seem positive enough (no miss-fires or doubles). Plus you naturally have the option of using the tablets touch screen in conjunction with the K380 keyboards character and navigation keys. With my 13\" Yoga 2 Pro Tablet the whole setup has the feel of a large laptop without the weight (when used on a table/desk).\nThe keyboard has a rather stingy one year Logitech warranty and the batteries lasts 'up to' 2 years (2 x AAA batteries supplied ready fitted). This K380 keyboard is far more useful than we thought it would be, and we can use it with our tablets as a remote control for media, so it sits around nearby ready to grab anytime when we are tableting. Overall it's a hit and 4*, assuming it lasts a lot longer than the batteries. It's not particularly light at 430g though, taking the combined tablet+keyboard weight to nearer 1.5 kg, but it is reasonably compact at 12.4 cm x 27.9 cm x 1.6cm for the backpack. Not an essential item for our tablets, but a useful addition none the less and my daughter now takes it to all her lectures. Plus it's not too expensive at around £35. My daughters only complaints are that the keyboard is 3.5cm wider than her 10.1\" tablet (so it looks ungainly with it - no problem with my 13\" Yoga 2 Pro) and that she was taking the batteries out when it's squashed into her carry bag/backpack, as it kept trying to pair with her tablet when she's using it without the keyboard (we've since found the physical on/off switch on the side of the keyboard, so that's no longer a problem). The Logitech keyboard packaging is such that it would be easy to repack the keyboard and return to Amazon for refund if you found you didn't get on with it, provided you unpack it carefully. Logitech say the keyboard also works with Apple products like iPads, iPhones, PCs and the AppleTV. I'm very happy with this K380 keyboard, it only loses a star for the 1 year warranty although our blue version is over two years old now and still working fine. To house my 13\" Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro Tablet I bought a \n, and this keyboard fits perfectly into the front zipped front pocket provided I put the keyboard in before the tablet."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Very happy with this. Bought it on sale and got it for £16. Was to replace my generic keyboard that I bought on here for £18 2 years ago which has constantly been failing to a point where the replacement stopped working after 2 weeks! That keyboard used a built in battery which I hate so much because you know that when it dies, you'll have to buy another. This keyboard has replaceable batteries! You have no idea how much I love that!\nI LOVE this keyboard so much. I can easily switch to different things like my Android phone and my pc. Because it uses Bluetooth over infrared I could even use it with my Amazon TV stick. No idea why more things don't use Bluetooth - I specifically look for Bluetooth over anything else now.\nThe keyboard connects quickly as I've even used it right on the login screen when my other keyboard would take a good few mins to connect and then fail to connect.\nIt feels durable but due to my last keyboard I decided to buy insurance (that's just me being a worrier though haha). I'll keep this review updated like I do all my reviews!\nIf you're looking to get a keyboard to work with multiple devices and also be compatible with Mac devices then this is the keyboard for you - - don't choose the cheaper options on Amazon because most of them use built in batteries that fail quick!"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I've bought this keyboard to go along with my mx master mouse for my macbook pro setup. The keyboard feels very well made and its quite heavy, witch gives it a solid build quality. The bluetooth connectivity is pretty decent, straight forward. I honestly did not liked the layout. Now, as I said, I pretty much bought this keyboard on the black color to go alongside with my black mouse. Both of the products are from logitech. I have now returned the keyboard due to the fact that this is not the same black as on the mouse, also, I'm not a big fan of the round keys.\nAltogether, this is a good keyboard, its not a 32pounds keyboard however. I successfully replaced the keyboard now with a JETech one and although the last one comes at a third of a price I prefer it better than this one. The black is black and is has exactly the same layout as the macbook keyboard has(US version)."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"This is just an initial review based upon receiving the item, getting it out of the box, switching it on and pairing it with my Lenovo TAB 3. The keyboard comes with 2xAAA alkaline batteries already in, you just pull the contact tape when you're ready to get going (to connect the batteries terminals). I paired the keyboard with my tablet in all of 30 seconds, obviously make sure Bluetooth is switched on in your tablet settings first. The instructions ask you to press and hold (for 3 seconds) the yellow #1 button on the keyboard. A six digit pass code is then prompted for on the screen of your tablet. Type this in on your Bluetooth keyboard and press enter. That should be it, now try typing something.........very easy in my experience. The keyboard has sufficient weight to it to allow speedy typing without the keyboard moving across the surface you might be using (a wood table in my case). It is quite sturdy in position and large enough for two hands to start moving around and typing away!"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Overall Conclusion:\nThis is a great and well built keyboard which does not take away a lot of space on your desk when in use, is easy to store when it is not and has a great quality feel when typing. Initially, I had some trouble connecting the keyboard to my MacBook Pro. However, once I had it set up properly, it has been working perfectly.\nHow to Use:\nThe keyboard arrives with batteries. Pull out the little tab that separates the batteries from the connection points and the keyboard will turn on. Connect it to your laptop using the instructions in the box and you are done.\nI did have some trouble connecting this to my MacBook. However, I believe this may have been due to me connecting an English keyboard to a German laptop. I have changed the keyboard settings in my MacBook to English (PC) and now it works perfectly fine with all keys mapped correctly.\nFeel:\nThe keyboard is very sturdy as you would expect from Logitech.

A lot of coding is entirely burst typing as you will be thinking then youll write some code or youll be ammending some code. You wont be writing essays when coding so its all good.\nI have not tested this keyboard for really writing a whole bunch but the keys feel crisp and nice. The only caveat is that you will have to get used to the keys as they are round instead of square like most keyboards, however this should only take the first day to really get used to but then a week or so to be completely comfortable with touch typing as a worst case\nNow the key reason i got this keyboard as it has the ability to be used on 3 devices and as someone who uses a mac mini, windows laptop and ubunu on the windows laptop its amazing as i dont need to use my old KVM switch nor multiple keyboards"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"After opting for a cheaper alternative a couple of years ago to pair with a new tablet, I came to the realisation that it really is better to pay slightly more for better quality. That's not to say that this keyboard is expensive, though — I'd consider it a very reasonable price to pay for something that feels sturdy, is compact but still big enough to comfortably use, and has great battery life.\nWhen I say I use this all the time, it's no exaggeration. I've given up using my PC altogether to write fiction on my tablet instead, and if it weren't for this keyboard I don't think I would've had that luxury. It makes typing a breeze, and on the rare occasions when I have to switch back to a full-size keyboard, I find myself missing the keys all being within comfortable reach of one another, and the lovely feel of the keys themselves.\nI couldn't give an exact estimate on the battery life, but given how much I actively use the keyboard and then how often I leave it on and forget to turn it off, I'm pleased that I've only had to replace the two AAA batteries on three occasions thus far — and I've been using cheap off-brand batteries, so that's a steal!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"It took moments to pair with my \n and, out of curiosity,  my amazing \nComfortable to type with and accurate after but a few minutes\nPackaging minimal (a good thing) - no manual but you can find it easily enough on the Logitech website and I'd rather not see the paper wasted..\nMedia & Hot Keys are useful, as are the {fn +} shortcut keys in  the Android environment .\nReason for buying as per headline... Both the Note 4 and the Tab have large screens. However, I find the software keyboard on the tablet too large to use efficiently and, to be honest, i'd rather not loose a quarter of the screen to it (a third if we just consider, say, the message body whilst composing in Gmail).\nThe only downside is that there's not an led indicator to say that the device is switched on (power on left edge) and no indication as to whether or the device has gone to sleep (or even what the sleep criteria is) . Therefore, I can imagine the 2 year battery life claim is likely to be considerably less if the keyboard is not switched off after use.\nI'm very pleased (Day one) ."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I have been using the Logitech K380 keyboard for only about half a day, but the ease with which I adapted to typing on it makes me think it will become a favourite.\nSo far I have used it to type code on my Windows 10 computer, to reply to Reddit posts on my mobile phone, and to control my home media system -- the last one mostly as a test of its capabilities. Pairing with these devices was straightforward, and switching the pairing from one device to another is instantaneous.\nDespite the unusual round keys, typing is very comfortable; this is probably because the keys are nearly full size and have sufficient space between them. But, pehaps the best thing about the typing experience is the feel: each keypress is light and quiet.\nBy default, in Windows 10 the Fn keys operate shortcuts. For example, F1 to F3 switch pairing; F4 navigates the browser to the homepage; F5 switches between applications; etc. This behaviour can be annoying when it causes the keyboard to switch pairing when you are not expecting it; but thankfully it can be changed to the normal function key behaviours with a setting in the Logitech Options software."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Brilliant stuff!\nYes, it may seem pricey for a small battery-powered keyboard, but the functionality is actually really great and it is very well built.\nPositives:\n- Small and easy to transport (but still a full-sized keyboard (sans number pad))\n- Has some weight to it, so it won't go skating around your desk when you're furiously typing out angry Amazon reviews\n- Connects in under 1 second one your device is registered\n- Works for Apple and Windows, flawlessly\n- Has a nice feel to it, and isn't very loud when typing, but quite satisfying to listen to\nNegatives:\n- Once connected to my MacBook, not all of the F keys were working, they were unresponsive when I pressed them. This was an issue, as the F4 key brings me to my apps home screen, which I use frequently! I quickly found the 'Logitech Options' app online and downloaded it to my MacBook, reset the keyboard to default for Mac, and boom, it worked! The problem was easily fixed, but not everyone would think to download this programme.\nThe only slight quarm I now have with the keyboard is that it can be confusing to know which symbols correspond to Mac and not to Windows. For example, the @ key is noted on two different keys on this keyboard, one in white, and one in light grey.

I've tried a number of cheap bluetooth keyboards, but they all have limitations - often you need to tap a key and wait for them to wake up and reconnect, or they're missing vital keys (the last one I used didn't have an escape key).\nI bought it for use with a Windows PC (which already had a Bluetooth adapter - there isn't one supplied so if you don't have Bluetooth already you'll need to purchase an adapter), but the ability to connect it to my iPad as well and swap between Windows and iPad at the press of a button is pretty useful as well.\nConnecting with both Windows 10 and iPad was completely drama-free.\nIt's more expensive that a lot of the cheapie no-name options, but as usual it pays to get quality in the long run. I'm turning into a bit of a Logitech shop here, not because I'm a particular fan, but just because they always end up being the items I stick with, after buying various other options and not being happy with them for one reason or another.\nCan't comment on battery life yet as I've only been using it a couple of days.

I liked the weight of this keyboard, however not the round keys, but decided to buy it anyway. After trying it with my Ipad/phone I decided to swap it with my work keyboard. Now, I’m quite fussy about keyboards (I’m a programmer), my work keyboard is nothing special, just an 8 year old bundled full size Dell keyboard that I happen to like (feels mechanical but isn’t). Within a few keystrokes I’d forgotten that my keyboard had changed and was working at full speed, that was 3 days ago and I’m still using it. The round keys haven’t been an issue at all, being roughly the same pitch as my fullsize keyboard, and pairing 3 devices and switching is really simple. I’d describe the feel of keypresses as being like a Macbook but heavier. Overall, I’m really impressed and I’m tempted to use this keyboard everywhere, and given this the only thing I’d change is to allow more than 3 devices to be paired (6 would be ideal)."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I can't actually rate this keyboard highly enough. I did quite a bit of research prior to purchasing and this one was consistently rated highly for all rounded usage/comfort/longevity.\nI really like how the three dedicated pairing buttons work to quickly switch between devices - coincidentally I have just three devices which I use the keyboard with, therefore they each have a button. It works so seamlessly to change device that I am able to use the K380 interchangeably in quick time. The little power switch at the side is conveniently located for access also. The slant of the keyboard as it's placed on a flat surface is just right for me personally. I also love the lightweight feel of it and it just looks good in this colour.\nThe keys feel great on my fingers - as a touch-typist this feel is quite important and is something I was slightly concerned about with the keys being circular shaped. However I needn't have worried because I'd say they actually feel better than the 50£ Apple keyboard that this has replaced. Even the sound of each key-press sounds like a melody to my ears. Really fantastic effort by Logitech in creating such a great device. My typing speed and accuracy has gone up as a result also which I am of course delighted about.\nLooking at this keyboard now, I cannot fault it in ANY way in honestly."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I have 3 computers in my office.\nMy company laptop - Windows 10\nMy personal desktop - Windows 10\nA Mac Mini - OSX High Sierra\nThis keyboard allows me to switch between all three really easily and declutters the desktop.\nI like the feel of the keys, and the build quality is great.  This was on sale at 24 quid, and so I bought a second one to tuck in the cupboard.\nMy one concern is that there's no Windows key.  I hardly ever remember to use the Windows key shortcuts, so it was not a big deal until I needed to open the Run command line.  So my fix was to install the free Classic Shell on Windows and now I have a Search line in my Start menu.  Problem solved."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"My Apple wireless keyboard (A1314) developed a fault, out of the blue. After reacquainting myself with the price of an Apple replacement I decided to quickly purchase a cheap replacement, for around £10. I quickly discovered this to be a mistake. The search then began to find a small bluetooth keyboard for my MacMini that was around £30 but had an impressive build quality. I was also looking for a recognised manufacturer that my MacMini would be able to most likely detect (the cheap keyboard I purchased wasn't detected and there were no drivers etc on the website for it). This keyboard seemed to fit the bill.\nPros & Cons:\n+ It's slightly heavier than the Apple A1314 keyboard and together with the lower typing angle makes it feel like it is glued to my desk.\n+ I like the feel and responsiveness of the keys, I can type faster with them than before.\n+ It has has a large enter key (it takes up 2 lines).\n+ It has a £ sign above the 3.\n+ It has an extra delete key which functions like a delete key on a full PC keyboard.\n+ \"Logitech Options\", a free download from the Logitech web site, adds additional customisable features such as on screen notification of when caps lock is on.\n- Some of the Mac functions of keys are labelled in a grey, making them hard to read.\n- The keys are circular and remind me of an old typewriter. This will not be to everyone's taste and might take some settling in time. However, personally, I really like them.\n- The fn keys are not the standard Apple A1314 layout. Instead of the regular functions above F1, F2 and F3 they are used for switching between devices. However, the functions such as volume and iTunes control work as expected and all the default keyboard shortcuts I regularly use work as expected too. \"Logitech Options\" allows you to make all F keys function as F keys and adds additional fn shortcut keys for Mac use.\n- The ctrl and fn keys are switched around (compared to the Apple A1314 layout).\nI highly recommend it and rank it up there with the Apple A1314 keyboard I previously had. I might even prefer it."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"My first experience with a wireless keyboard (also from Logitech) did not go well, so I was hesitant to buy another wireless one - I'd promised myself to stick with wired products because they're just more reliable. However, asides from a few small things, I am really pleased with this one.\nSo first of all it is really nice to type on for me - it doesn't feel as clunky as other keyboards I've used, I like the look of it, and while I was a bit unsure about the circular keys at first, I haven't found them to be a problem at all. In fact, I think I prefer them. That said I do have small hands, so I imagine that this feels more natural to me because I'm no longer having to stretch for the keys. And one of the reasons I bought it was because of the size - my last keyboard made me type diagonally to the left which was uncomfortable and unhealthy, this one doesn't.\nHowever, sometimes it can be a pain to get to the keyboard to connect to whatever device you're using. It usually connects just fine to my computer, mostly anyway, but it can be a little more finicky with my phone. I haven't had a single time yet when it connects straight away and usually involves switching off the keyboard, switching off the phone, and spending a few minutes getting it to connect. But once the device is connected it stays that way.\nAdditionally there are two small problems that occur near the beginning of connection. Either the keyboard will lag slightly for a few seconds, or it'll be overly sensitive for a few seconds, producing extra letters. But once it's past those few seconds it works flawlessly, thus far.\nThe only other downside for me is that the keyboard doesn't register as existing, for me, until my computer has fully loaded up.\nIt's a little early to comment on battery life or if it'll start to glitch out like the last product I tried, but if it does I'll be sure to update my review."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"The keyboard is nice and the functionality is good jn theory, I had a few issues with the connectivity, when you use it with different devices, some you have to pair it again or when you lock the screen sometimes it won't pair afterwards. I have changed an option in Bluetooth settings so it has improved, but in general the keyboard is good, small, portable, nice looking, it's all plastic but it seems durable. And if the 3 buttons for Bluetooth are pretty handy when it works properly. The support from logitech is very bad, I have written them but they didn't reply at all.  I found a few solutions about issues in different forums."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"This is a really great keyboard, very tactile and (as a touch typist) the rounded keys don't even register as an issue.  The battery life is great (I've been on the same set for 2 months).  The ability to connect to 3 devices is great and it is very easy to switch between them.\nSo why 3 stars?  This is a UK keyboard (which I specifically sought) however it is stuck on a US layout on my apple devices.  Is this an apple issue or a Logitech issue?  I don't know and can't find an answer so am a bit disappointed.  Nevertheless, it is a great product."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Had this long enough to post a review.  I use it with a Mac and i got it to replace the apple magic keyboard, which looks and types great, but the battery life was rubbish and it ate through rechargeable cells.  It also lacked the delete button and could only be paired with one device at a time.  This keyboard meets all those requirements and is compact, easy to type on, never loses connection and can be paired to 3 devices.\nThe only thing it lacks is an illuminated keys and the typing experience is a little more positive with each keystroke than the Apple offering, which is not a bad thing - just different.  Still using the same batteries it came with and still looking great."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I have started connecting my laptop to a raised external monitor at work to reduce the strain on my neck, and so required a new keyboard.\nThis is device is great. It connected to my Lenovo  Windows laptop, Dell Windows tablet and LG Android phone easily, and works great.\nI had issues when using this keyboard at the same time as my Microsoft Sculpt Bluetooth mouse. There was some kind of interference, and it was acting as if keys were being held dowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwn.\nSince switching mouse, the issue has resolved.\nI've dropped a star for this, but I'm unsure is the fault is with the laptop, keyboard or mouse however.\nOverall I'd definitely recommend this device to others.\nIt's a shame they don't do a version with a number pad and the ability to switch between 3 devices, but I can't have everything!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I tend to wait to review items, but I'll make an exception unless things turn ugly... After a few hours of using this keyboard, it's great. Travel distance and feel it's the best I've had on a Bluetooth keyboard, circular keys really easy to hit as I touch-type. Tiny arrow keys are the worse thing about the device, but I can live with that, it's pretty usual these days. It has connected without any issues to 3 devices, Windows PC, Nexus 7 and Windows Phone, switches at the touch of a button (you can change it to \"fn press first\" with a Logitech software utility from their website, if you use lots of F11 and so).\nIt looks great in blue, UK layout in my case, as the part number at the bottom of the description stated, always difficult to tell since the product just has the American layout in the package cover. I'm so happy I went for this instead of the expensive K810 (I didn't like the feel on that one). Totally recommended."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Having tried a number of Bluetooth keyboards in recent years, the Logitech K380 is one of the easiest and fastest to connect to all of my different devices - including desktop, Windows and Mac laptops, iPad. The yellow switching buttons make it really simple to swap between them once paired, ideal if you’ve got a multi device setup. The keyboard looks really smart, the round keys are a bit different to your ‘conventional’ look and feel and have not been any detriment to my typing speed as some reviews have hinted. Size is just perfect - small enough to avoid stretching for the mouse but big enough that you’re not cramped on a tiny set of keys. Perfect if you have RSI. Would definitely recommend for this price!"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"As someone who uses rugged mechanical keyboards, I made a mistake purchasing this. The good points are that it is slim and that It has some nifty features such as easily switching from device to device using bluetooth and the round keycaps look aesthetically pleasing.\nHowever, for my intended use - replacing a permanent keyboard on my desk - it doesn't quite feel like a real keyboard, it's more like a toy due to its unusual small size, slim profile and light weight plastic
