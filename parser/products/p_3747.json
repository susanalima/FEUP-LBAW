Have used them for a few hours and they sound good. Don't really believe the notion about having to burn headphones in. I think it is a bit of a myth. These sound great right out of the box.\nSound is well balanced and the stereo image pretty wide. I got these as a replacement for some AKG 44s because the elastic on the self adjusting band came loose but I really liked the self adjusting system on those ones and these ones have the same one. I was unfortunate with that happening on my other headphones, after about 4 months use, considered, just a bit if bad luck, hopefully these ones won't  suffer from the same issue.\nI saw some reviews elsewhere, There are not many, at this time as these are fairly new on the market.  One said they had a weak bass response or that they sounded boxy Don't know what they are talking about.. I haven't found that at all.\nThe frequency range of these phones according to the AKG site, is 18hz - 20,000khz As the adult human ear can only hear 20 hz to around 18,000 hz which gradually reduces as you age. For reference. The bottom note on a full sized 88 note piano is 27.5 hz the top note is 4,186 Hz.\nThese cover a perfectly adequate spectrum. I think the stereo image sounds a shade wider than the K44s did and they are even more comfortable to wear\nTop range is not too bright or harsh. Mid range is clearly represented. Bass is rich and detailed, without being over emphasised just like the K44s were. The top band on these K52s is made of metal instead of plastic like the K 44s and they have replaceable earpads, which the earlier model didn't have. Though no instructions come in the box to tell you how to do so but the fact that they have them, gives the impression, they expect these headphones to last a fair while. Have to look on YouTube to find for a video on how to do it, if I need to.\nThe cable is 2.5 metres or 8ft 2 inches long and build quality, very reasonable at this price under £30.\nTried various types of music through them, including some of my own and. all the detail was represented. As I played each instrument on these tracks, I would have noticed if sounds were muffled or missing.\nThese I bought to use on my Nexus 10 tablet and they are fairly  loud. I have to make sure not to have the volume up all the way.\nI compared these to my old Audio Technica ATH M30 headphones which I use on my computer upstairs, the AKG52s have much more bass response than those do and probably slightly less treble, that impression was born about  when I checked the frequency response quoted for each of them the K52s quoting 18hz - 20,000khz and the M30s quoting  20hz - 20,000khz. The bass difference, is very noticeable between these two, the treble sounding smoother and less harsh on the K52s, though both are quoting the same figure for that top frequency range. Sound isolation very good much better than the ATH M30s, though to be fair, they are getting on a bit...\nAll in all very pleased with them at this budget price.. Just hope the self adjusting band holds up this time.\nSee my AKG K44 review for that story... The AKG52s have similarities to those but I actually think they sound a bit better, seem a better quality build too, let's hope time proves me correct."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Needed some headphones that were more \"honest\" when I was mixing down tracks in the project studio. My budget was limited at the time and I saw some really good reviews of the K92s. I can say I have not been disappointed. For this price point, they are fantastic. I use a pair of Sennheisers at work for mixing that cost 5 times as much and I can honestly say, I prefer to use the AKGs. They just feel nice on the ear. The Sennheisers give you head fatigue fairy quickly, but the AKGs I can wear for hours at a time, without the feeling of having your head squashed in a vice and having an eyeball pop out all while Joe Pesci is shouting at you.\nFrom an aural honestly point of view, they are certainly letting me hear what's going on in the mix and most importantly, at least for me, is it they don't add any \"sparkle\" to the highs. No longer do the post-mix high-hats sound like someone hitting a wet pillow with a spatula.\nTL:DR\nGreat cans for the money. Would recommend to any project studio on a budget."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These headphones are such amazing value.\nI don't want to sound like I'm bragging, but I have tons of headphones, some sets that I have are almost 5 times the amount of this set, so here's my honest review of the AKG 52's.\n-Design\nDesign wise, the AKG's are nothing particularly special. The design is non offensive and generally subtle. I do like how the 'L' and 'R' indicators are located in the ear cups, and they're nice and big so you always know which way round the set goes.\nThe cable is nice and thick, about 2 meters in length.\nIt has a self-adjustable headband which I was originally sceptical about, but in reality it's a really good idea. The set just relaxes into a nice position.\nPlease note: The set does not fold, or twist, so it may not be an ideal choice for DJ's or people who need something more compact.\nThe earcups are pretty large and I'm sure will fit over most ear sizes.\nThe build quality is of a high standard.\n-Comfort\nThese headphones are nice and light. Due to the self-adjustable headband, the headset doesn't really need any cushioning. You could wear this set for hours and it would never be a problem.\nI'd consider these to be more for home audio use than on the move, and I wouldn't recommend them for gym use. They would just keep slipping off your head.\n-Sound\nI honestly struggle to find anything I do not like about this set. The sound is nicely balanced, bass is neat and we'll driven, but is not overwhelming or muddy. The mids and highs and crisp and easy to identify even if the music is bass-heavy. Music through the headphones is exciting and clean.\nThere is SO MUCH SPACE. I cannot emphasize how spacial these headphones sound. (If you're thinking 'what the heck is this guy on about' I'm sure there is an audiophile glossary that can explain what space is in relation to headphones).\nThese are actually my go-to set for music.\nAs for the cons, they are pretty minimal. If you like really energetic bassy trance-style music and you like being thumped in the head by the bass, I would probably advise going elsewhere. (I would normally recommend Sony for this kind of music). The AKG's produce more of a warm, natural sound.\nIf anything the set may be a little too warm sounding at times, which is great if you're listening to acoustic music, classical, jazz or smooth hip-hop...etc. I listen to a lot of Heavy Metal, and although I'm more than happy to listen to metal through these headphones, I feel like some headsets may deliver a bit of a better experience, but in honesty, I'm nit-picking.\nFor £30 they do a stellar job. I feel as though this set should be priced around the £50-£60 range, so £30 is a bargain."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These are just perfect for me!\nThey feel solid and are super comfortable. That's what I enjoy the most about these headphones - no discomfort whatsoever even after having them on for 5-6 hours a day at work. Still working perfectly after 6 months even though they fall of my desk a few times a day.\nSound quality is great, although you wouldn't need to try very hard in order to spot the difference between these and higher end models.\nHowever, definitely worth every penny of the £42 I paid.\nThey are not noise cancelling (not advertised to be either) but they are closed and effective in filtering out ambient office noise.\nCouldn't be happier with this purchase."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I would give a 4.5 to these headphones. Purchased 3 months ago so plenty of time to test them. They are confortable, can wear them 3 hours or so without the need of taking them off to rest, they don't cook your ears and the elastic headband works perfect (I was afraid when I first saw them as it didn't seem very good quality).\n-  Buy this for watching films with headphones or listening to pop/light rock/classical/indie/country.Clear sound, detailed, balanced. Dialogues are amazing.\n - Don't buy this if looking for bass, no way. Don't buy this for comuting, they don't have external noise reduction at all and they have the 3m cable. The ear caps are massive, so if you have a \"small\" head don't even try.\nOverall, great for under 40 quid, but bear in mind that this should be for house/studio use only, as the noise isolation is not there."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"After much research and reading of reviews I decided to go by the recommendation of WhatHiFi and bought the AKG K52 headphones.\nAfter many hours of use I have found that the self-adjusting headband and lightweight design make these headphones extremely comfortable to wear.\nThe sound provided by the 40mm drivers is excellent with a very good bass response and clarity.\nAll frequencies are handled well and provide excellent range and balanced definition.\n(NB. Strangely, the sound quality when initially used was disappointing and worthy of only a 3 star rating, at best, but the more the headphones were used the more the performance improved to that expected and after that 'running in' period continue to perform as required.)\nI use these headphones primarily with my iPad to listen to my iTunes music library, the supplied 6mm jack adaptor does however allow me to plug the headphones into my HiFi amplifier, which is a bonus.\nFor the purposes of my requirements these headphones represent excellent value for money."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Using these headphones for monitoring my guitar through a multi effects unit.  Headphones are very light and comfortable. The sound response is not biased towards bass or treble so ideal for getting an honest representation."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Closed back?  I know that's what it says, both here an on the AKG site, but there is so much sound leakage they are more liike OPEN back!\nI currently have 6 different pairs of headphones, including both cheap and moderately priced closed back headphones (Sennheiser HD202 II, Beyerdynamic Custom One Pro, and a couple of others).\nWhat they all have in common is they block out a lot of the ambient sound.\nThese things are the complete opposite!  I can hear EVERYTHING going on, even myself trying to type quietly right now while wearing them, every keystroke is almost as loud as if I wasn't wearing them at all.\nI also own a pair of Samson open back headphones, and they are EXACTLY like these in that I can hear everything around me (annoying when the AKG site boasts 'Closed-back design\nmaximizes isolation').\nThere is also what sounds like a small screw rolling arounf in the Right ear cup, which is bloody annoying!\nSound quality wise, they are as expected.  quite neutral, but with great frequency response and clarity.  Bass is deep and punchy, but not overpowering and boomy.  Mids and highs are nice and crisp, but ever so slightly tinny.\nThe foam pads are a little on the firm side, adding to the lack of sound isolation as they do not form around the side of your head very well (this was not the sole cause of the lack of isolation though, as pressing the earcups firmly into my head made little difference).\nI would have loved these headphones, if not for the lack of isolation and the loose part inside the right cup.\nIf you want a pair of cans that block out a decent amount of ambient sounds, these are NOT the cans for you."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I'm using these to monitor my Electric Guitar via an external audio Interface - they are very lightweight and you can wear them for hours without any issues or getting too hot.\nYou should be aware that there are three things that may put people off:\n3M Cable - If you damage it, the headphones are rendered useless (not really an issue)\nFlat EQ - There is no \"extra bass\" or certain kinds of EQ that some people are used to - I play heavy metal and these do \"lack\" bass, but the clarity of everything is is brilliant.\nYour ears WILL touch the inside of the mesh - These are very \"streamlined\" headphones, so it does feel strange, but does not impact the performance or comfort of the headphones whatsoever."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I've had these for a few months and am really enjoying them. The sound quality is better than any other headphones or earphones I've ever had, and belies the price tag. The balance is good, and the sound is clear and without distortion. I have read other reviews saying the sound stage is not as expansive or well-defined as with more expensive headphones. That may be true, but I certainly don't have any complaints.\nThey are really comfy, thanks to that wide leather band at the top. Quite lightweight, at least for the size, and the weight is well-distributed so they don't feel heavy on your head. The gold trim is eye-catching but not flashy. They are a little flat in shape, which means that your ears may well touch the inside of the headphones (but it doesn't bother me). The cable is very long, which is great for using while seated, but sometimes gets in the way a little when out and about. I use these for music a lot, but also for gaming. Great for both."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I actually bought 2 pairs of these, the 1st ones I got for my old man who is quite hard of hearing, so I gave him my old Av amp connected to his TV and sky box, and got these AKG's to go with it, I tested them and very impressive sound from an AV amp onto these, so much so its literally changed his life, he can now spend the rest of whats left! of it listening to his favourite movies n tv lol\nI was that impressed I bought a pair myself, however I had a noisy/crackly jack, rather than get them replaced I thought I would order the AKG92's which im about to review, but all in all great headphones for an amazing price, so if you do get a dodgy pair, definitely at least swap them out as they are amazing,"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These are definitely worth the asking price of £40. They have a really good looking design, very light weight and have excellent sound.\nThey sound flat and do equalize pretty well. They are not lacking bass at all, just not bass heavy but with a little EQ they produce good bass.\nThe cups are very comfortable and the material is like leather and doesn't irritate or get sweaty due to how light and spacious they are.\nThey are also very good for movies and gaming and are very easy to drive. I have tested them with an Astro Mix Amp and a Creative AE-5 sound card and the AKG sound great with either.\nI also have a set of DT770 80 Ohms and while costing a lot less, the AKG 92 hold their own.\nI gave away a set of Samson SR850 headphones as when comparing them to the AKG 92, the Samson was very harsh in the upper frequency and not as comfortable.\nThe AKG 92 may be the best headphones under £50. I am waiting to see how durable they are and will update this review if they break in the near future."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These headphones are such terrific value. I use them for  while recording on 16 track recorder for monitoring/mixing, also for monitoring while playing guitars & mandolin's  through various processors. They are superb when used for general music listening of CD's etc through various players along with my little Zen personal digital player... and outperform previous units (costing more) I have used. These phones are suitable for almost any use, and are superb in my opinion for music recording and mixing...whats more, they are very comfortable. I highly recommend you consider the AKG K92."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"So purchased these as I did not want to spend much on headphones as don't use them often. I made the choice to purchase these having looked at reviews on a well known technology technology website.\nOverall I am happy. They look good and are very comfy to wear. The cable is long and no issues with the fit.\nThe sound is good for the price. The highs and mid range sound is good. These do lack in bass but for the price these are a good value option. Are these going to be as good in comparison to headphones in the £200 bracket... Then no. But for the price then apply some expectation management and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Really good quality sound for the price. I have  found these to have good sound clarity for a variety of genres.\nDue to their over-ear nature I feel very isolated and closed off to external sounds which is great.\nThere are a few issues I have with these headphones, mainly their sound bleed. With the volume just above 50% you can generally hear whatever you are listening to pretty clearly upon taking them off.\nThis, paired with the extremely long cable, means they are best used at home and not in public."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Having owned many headphones over the years I know that they can be a big disappointment. (Grado, Yamaha Sennheiser etc.) I really like two things about these headphones. The most important is sound quality and I have to say these knock spots off most of the competition in terms of sheer quality of sound. It's so hard to get a great balance across the frequencies and these K92's deliver with ease. I read a couple of reviews about them being light in Bass. They're absolutely not, the bass is rounded and perfectly reproduces what's sent to it. Rock and classical content shine with equal veracity. These phones are the best. The second thing is comfort and the phones adjust themselves to the size of the head instantly and sit very comfortably without moving about. I wore them for walking sessions on the treadmill and they successfully muted the external  noise of the treadmill to virtually nothing. They're not advertised as sound cancelling but they successfully mute external sounds. They are the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned and they didn't get hot while walking on the treadmill."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"When these headphones arrived, I opened the box & they looked great. Tried them on & they were very comfortable. I tried them out with a few different cd tracks of different types of music and the sound was good. A few days later, I put them on to listen to some music. After about 10 minutes, the left headphone speaker failed. I tried the headphones with different music players that I knew worked perfectly, and used another set of headphones on the same players & there were no problems with them. So after about 20 minutes of use, these supposedly good quality headphones failed.Not at all what I expected. I have given 1 star only because the headphones looked good & were very comfortable, unfortunately, the electronics are obviously poorly manufactured. Amazon were excellent, the headphones were returned & I quickly received a refund ."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Straight out of the box I noticed a rattle in the right ear, some loose plastic or some such.\nI then found the elasticated headband needed to be quite extended to get the ear cups over my ears comfortably.\nThis sadly means that the whole frame of the headphone is under load from the quite tight elastic on the headband and it makes the headphones as comfortable as wearing a springloaded pair or tongs, awful and extremely uncomfortable.\nThe sound however is very very good for the money, midranges are superb.\nSadly however as good as they sound I have no desire to sit with my head in a clamp and the bits of plastic floating around the ear cup means they went back the next day."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"If you want a really good quality set of headphones for an affordable price then you won't go far wrong with these. The sound is great, they feel solidly built, and they are genuinely comfortable to wear.\nIf you want a set of headphones for your daily commute then they're probably not the right choice. The wire is quite thick and long, not easy to tuck away inside a coat for example. These are more the sort of headphones you'd connect to a good stereo and shut the outside world away. Or they'd probably make a good set of affordable studio headphones. For the right buyer these are an excellent buy."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I have a habit of buying a new pair of headphones every few months and this is my honest take on these.\nBuild quality seems OK for the budget price, along with comfortable fit.\nHave only been listening to them for around an hour now but don't think they will get used much by me.\nSound seems to be pronounced more in the upper mid end of the spectrum than I enjoy for general purpose listening\nTight crisp highs and emphasized in mids for sure, Rich bass and warm lower mids are definitely lacking however, just too punchy for me.\nThey will have their use from time to time i'm sure, especially for reference listening, Just not warm or deep enough for my preference in day to day music enjoyment with the genres I listen to.\nOn to the next pair.\nMay change this review after a few days break in if they move more to my taste. Unlikely them changing that much though."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"These headphones come in a smart black and gold appearance with a retro feel - the kind of headphones that \"Radar\" might have been wearing in M.A.S.H.  The build quality is excellent with high quality materials used throughout.\nThey are studio headphones, designed to be worn all day long.  To achieve these, the earcups are made of a soft material and the spring mechanism has just the right amount of tension to keep the cups pressed on the ears without being unpleasant.\nThe sound quality is reasonably good, making these headphones excellent value for money.  The headphones have a flat response curve that accurately reproduces the recorded sound."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I'm suitably impressed with these headphones. I bought them for mixing my podcast on a reccomendation. I used to use a very bass heavy, poor quality pair of headphones and always had to overcompensate in my mixing so it was all guess work. Using these I was able to almost instantly improve my mix and it was significantly easier. For the price they really must be hard to beat. I used to own a pair of grado that cost an embarrasing amount and whilst they were good, I prefer these for mixing. Same goes for just about every other pair of standard headphones I've used to try to mix with. They give you a very honest sound and I think especially for podcasts which aren't overly demanding in complexity of the mix, I think they're hard to beat for the price.\nThe actual construction does feel a tiny bit cheap, though they look very good, but there's a lot of plastic and the lack of a removable cable is a shame, but they're small gripes and in a sense, it's good that the cost appears to have all gone into the sound, which is the important thing at the end of the day. Thebcable isnalsonvery long, which givesnyou a lot of freedom to move about and doesn't tie you down on the spot. They're very comfortable to wear and the over ear vibe doesn't cause any pain or annoyance after prolonged periods. Your ears do get quite warm but they don't give you a sweaty head which I've suffered before with other headphones.\nOverall I have to say I'm really impressed and think they were a great buy, absolutely worth the low price when compared to other studio phones. I docked them a star for not being able to switch out the cable and for being almost entirely plastic, but that almost feels harsh. Great value, great headphones."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"For it's price, it's a fantastic little set of headphones having a light build and ruling out harsh frequencies, alongside having high quality audio output. I use these headphones for hours at a time causing lots of soreness to my ears forcing me to either wear them over a hat or hoodie to keep my ears from being destroyed. I would however recommend these headphones for anyone listening to music for short lengths of time, perhaps this isn't what I was looking for afterall, nevertheless, solid pair of headphones for the light user."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"Update:\nAfter a few days of gentle use around the house I noticed the occasional sound drop-out from the left earphone. I would find myself wiggling the cable in an attempt to replicate the problem but I think it was unrelated to the wiring. I liked these headphones and found them extremely comfortable with great sound, as you can see from my original review, but lacking any kind of warranty beyond the first 30 days, I decided to return them for a refund.\nOriginal review:\nThese are great headphones. Extremely comfortable and a nice headband that self-adjusts, requiring, and indeed allowing, no manual adjustment by the wearer. The sound is great and very neutral to my ears. No excessive bass or highs but a full sounding mid-range, well-balanced and full. The cable cannot be detached however and for my purposes is far, far too long, trailing around and tying me in knots in bed and sitting in an armchair. I hate the cable but some people may like this if their stereo source is in a foreign country perhaps. Quality is excellent and they feel as though they will last a long time. There is no creaking when moving your head from side to side and the whole unit feels well made. I can recommend these, especially with the built-in skipping rope length cable that allows you to keep fit while listening, assuming you haven't broken your legs tripping over it while making a cup of tea."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These AKG K92 replaced a set of older Sennheisers, which i thought were good...These blow me away. The sound is superb, with great seperation, and smooth bass...instrumental music sounds real and can be listened to for hours without fatigue...Build quality is superb but be warned...these are for use in a studio or in the home, and will not take outdoor punishment. In this price range, nothing beats these K92s....Recommended without reservation."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"My long suffering sennheisers finally gave up. Something I was dreading as I got them for a great price and wasn't looking forward to the inevitable drop in quality when they needed replacing as I couldn't justify spending £££.\nSpotted these. Thought for £30 they were worth a go. Really glad I took a punt. They're very lightweight. Which means they're very comfortable when worn. The sound quality is IMHO just as good as my previous much more expensive headphones.\nI'm not an audiophile but these sound great and for £30 I can't find a single negative point."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Hard to complain about the sound at this price - £30 is entirely reasonable. Build pretty solid, and they feel solid on my bonce. I've had over the ear headphones before (albeit considerably more expensive) and have an idea of what I like. The inner sponge pad touches my ears, which I find peculiar. I don't have big, sticky out ears, it's just that the cans are...shallow. It's enough of a distraction for me to be disappointed on the first use. I can't imagine I'll get used to it, but at this price I'll try."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Got these recently- they’re ok, but perhaps not what I was expecting. I’m not an expert btw.\nOn the box it says 'studio', and I guess that's really what they are for - for use in a recording or editing suite, or on an electronic piano where you want to hear exactly what the output is like.\nThere's no distortion I can hear and the sound is clear, but they are relatively quiet on a mobile phone or tablet (which is about the device, not the headphones maybe?). There are no volume/other controls on the headphone itself.  They are large and bulky, and I would say that that, combined with the long lead, makes that a probable no for commuting.\nI've bought other Bluetooth AKG headphones and have been very impressed, but I don't think these are a consumer focused item. More for work if you're in that field, or with some kind of and in-between device/amp/high end home system to deliver what you'd like to hear, rather than what is.\nI see the price has gone down from £26 to £20 since I bought them. Grrr.\nAlso they’re not shown on the AKG website, so maybe they are phasing them out.\nSo, no complaints really as they’re a fair price, just an ‘ok’ for now. No cable problems so far... Next time I plan to go into an actual shop and have a listen before buying..."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Fast delivery as usual, I bought these based on numerous reviews from various main stream publications and on line tests and generally the rating was very high. I have tested these over a couple of months on various music and have found them to be lacking in many ways. Firstly the bass is minimal this gives the overall sound a quality that lacks warmth they don't make you feel part of the music and after about 10 minutes you find them fatiguing and bright and harsh.
