I would have removed a star for these, but...the DVD is RW ! Have the star back ! It also seems to have a choice of Win7 or Win10. I am still generally sticking to Win7 on other computers, so its nice to have a budget one to practice Win10 on.\nThe niggles might have been frustrating for somebody not comfortable with opening it up, and not having a spare power lead handy, but for me it is really good, and well worth it."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"This computer has proved to be a complete waste of money!
