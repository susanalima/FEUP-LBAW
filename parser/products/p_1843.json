I think i hear a tiny amount more detail in the mid range.\nAll in all a bit more controlled when a large orchestra goes full throttle- then i find the 701 can sound a little strained and harsh at the treble end and a little less clear in the mid range when, say a Mahler or Wagner orchestra comes to a massive crescendo.\nThe k712 is also a better all rounder than the K701, being adept at rock and pop music.\nThe 712 is also less fatiguing for longer listens.\nFor all the above reasons i think the 712, at its current price,  is worth the extra money over the still very fine 701 (which is now a stone cold bargain if you want a highly detailed, neutral open ear head phone)."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"If you primarily listen to classical music, these wonderful headphones may be of interest to you. Spacious sound stage, neutral rather than accentuated bass, beautiful mid range, detail forensically rendered.\nBe aware that they need a headphone amp to be properly driven and sound their best.\nThese are currently selling for £140- they were AKG's flagship consumer reference model when launched and sold for hundred's of pounds more at the time. At the current price they are remarkable value if you are looking for a detailed, largely neutral headphone.\nIf you are looking for a warm or smooth sound these are not what you need, nor are they ideal for rock and pop recordings- but if you primarily listen to classical music, they are phenomenal, and at the current, much discounted price, a  real find."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I have only recently caught up with this AKG headphone model, having previously owned AKG Q701 & K702  models. My current pair are AKG K240 Mk2s. I much prefer these to the Q701/K702s which I find too bass light  and with exaggerated left/right stereo. The K240s have a far better balance left/right, front/rear & top/bottom and are THE ubiquitous studio headpone with good reason. They are accurate.\nThe K712s have the exact same sound balance as the K240s, even to the point of operating at exactly the same volume level on the headphone amp. They improve on the K240s with a larger soundscape, which gives each instrument more space and being larger & better built they are more comfortable for long periods. You can further improve their clarity, neutrality & impact by fitting leather Dekoni AKG Elite\nFenestrated ear pads, which are a significant upgrade in sound & comfort on the £20 velvet originals, and also by upgrading the cable - I use a  2.5m Naim Grey/Neutrik jacks lead.\nThe 712s are used on the end of a dedicated Naim headphone system and they  play all music, be it Beatles, Zappa, Ellington or Boulez, with  absolute aplomb & equanimity. The only downside is, being a true studio headphone, they will show up any faults in the recording or your hi fi chain. But if you want the unadulterated truth, warts and all, beauty and all, this is one of the most acurate headphones on the planet. Add in the very reasonable price in true audiophile terms (even after adding an extra £140 for the upgraded pads & cable. ) If you can't stretch to the upgrades get the standard 712s, if you can't stetch to them go for the 240s at £70 - then start saving!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Large but lightweight. Very detailed and revealing performance. Very flat frequency response. Well-matched transducers, professional levels of sound quality. Fantastic stereo sound-stage. Comfortable to wear. Long lead.\nThese headphones have relatively high impedance and low sensitivity. They are very fussy about the amplifier and sound awful with some electronics. Even the headphone output of my HiFi amp sounds poor. Surprisingly, they sound great when driven directly from my old PC sound card. There's no doubt that a top quality headphone amp is best, I built one for this purpose and it sounds excellent but of course commercial headphone amplifiers are available and the good ones are well worth it. Don't be disappointed if you get this product and it sounds poor - just try some different devices or amplifiers and you will be rewarded with very fine sound indeed."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"So these headphones started acting up after a few months, sometimes it was intermittent. This is a problem. Now it was definitely something physical because the audio would only cut out for a split second when I would get up out of my chair or when I moved my cable. Was it my other hardware? I thought it was probably the flimsy 3m cable but couldn't pinpoint where in the cable it was, so I thought maybe it's the plug, I'll just get another cable. Seemed good, for a day or so, then it started happening again.\nI opened them up. Exploring inside, the yellow wire has been in contact with the rod soldered to the red wire, this caused the plastic coating on the yellow wire to melt. What in the fricking heck is this? How? You can pull the yellow wire so it's under the red and out of the way when you replace the plastic part...."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These headphones are quite simply fantastic! They seem to be getting even better every time I put them on, could be burn in, could be placebo, who knows? All I do know is that they put a smile on my face and give me goosebumps... They're that good!\nBass, mid, and treble all represented with such clarity and realism.\nThese phones are definitely a bit special."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"For the €126 that I paid, these earphones are absolutely splendid. I see from reveiws that people nowadays prefer headphones with a heavy bass bias. These render the sound precisely as it has been recorded; that is, without any bias.. Understandably, they are therefore normally used for audio work. I use them for both audio mastering and simple listening to classical music. I thought I would need to turn up the base, but I found the sound 'as is' perfect for my large collecton of classical music. So, I highly recommend them for listening to classical music (and anyway for their normal use in the monitoring of sound during production). They're very comfortable too."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Very impressed! I'm one of those guys that collect headphones and have owned most of the best/most expensive one's on the market. Having owned the classic AKG K702's in the past, I was expecting the K712's to be an improvement - yes they are! The main area of improvement over the K702 is the bass...but it also has a slightly wider soundstage. I also own the K612's and they simply don't compare! Yes the K612's are very natural sounding but they don't have the technical capabilities of the K712's. Portable devices can drive them well as they are 62ohm but when driven from an amplifier or hifi system they are VERY satisfying. You wont find a better pair of audiophile-grade headphones for anything less than £400. Even when compared to the \"creme dela creme\" of higher priced headphones, these would be in my top 10! They are very capable..."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"How do I explain these headphones?\nAwesome? I don't feel that to be a strong enough word.\nAmazing? They are that and then some.\nI'll just explain (quickly) why.....\nThe first time I used these I thought they were nice headphones, pretty comfy and I suffer from a neurological disorder that makes me hypersensitive so I need really comfy headphones and these are pretty good at first but they are slowly getting better as the 3d foam seems to be getting more pliable and the fitting system is excellent as it doesn't squash your head and just sits on top of your head nicely.\nThey cover my ears really well and the cable doesn't get in the way and is soft and not heavy.\nBut the sound.......it's almost like I was partially deaf before but now I can hear everything!!!!!!\nJust to explain, I was listening to an orchestral soundtrack and everything was incredibly clear, like I was actually sitting I the middle of the musicians and the sound was all around me.\nBut I could hear a strange scratchy kind of sound every now and again and couldn't work it out - was it a cable problem or was it the source itself?\nNo - it was the sound of the musicians turning the pages of their sheet music!!!!\nI put my Sony closed back headphones on as a comparison and it was so different, they just sounded like headphones do but the AKG K702's sound like you are there, in the room with the musicians and they pick up every sound in the room.\nSuper incredible audio amazement - yeah, that'll do it.\nAnd so cheap at the moment for what you get its almost unbelievable - I think they are £300 odd cheaper than they were a few months ago."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Fair to say I haven't got a massive amount of Audiophile quality headphone experience. I bought these to replace an gaming headset with a view to actual quality sound reproduction and wasn't bothered about the Mic on PC. After a mass of research, I decided to go for the AKG's. Even with the necessary additional cost of an Amp (Creative SoundBlaster Omni, which has a reasonable Mic on it.), when compared directly with a similar \"high quality\" headset, they simply blow my Astro A50's out the window. For both quality and cost. The sound reproduction is something else, from Games and music.\nThe only slight issue I have got is a few YouTube video's by my favourite creators show some serious flaws in their attention to detailed Audio Quality. This is like going from a SD to HD TV, you suddenly notice the flaws. Very Impressive. From the reviews ive seen they take a day or so play to really warm up and break themselves in. Cant wait."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"I bought these on February 26th, 2018. I'm writing this on April the 30th, 2018.\nThese headphones sound good, are lovely to wear, and are designed nicely. It's a shame that after two months of use, they're broken.\nI've treated these headphones with the utmost care - they cost over £100 - yet the right ear cup seems to have a loose connection inside it. This started happening a few days ago, and as I'm writing this review the right speaker seems to have totally given up. It is now playing absolutley nothing, no matter how I tilt my head or position the earcup. For a product that costs £113, this is utterly unnacceptable for it to have broken after 2 months of careful use.."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"These are open-back phones, so I was prepared for sound leakage - but it is more than I was expecting.  At a comfortable listening volume for oneself (not especially loud), it would be irritating for anyone else in the same room - even quite a large room.\nOtherwise, fantastically pure sound, perfectly balanced, very comfortable to wear.  Compared with my (very old) Sennheiser HD40s, they feel huge - like having two comfy pillows clamped to your head - but not overly heavy.  But despite the much larger size, they are actually more comfortable to wear.  The sound is marginally quieter than the HD40s, but seems a little more \"honest\".  That may be purely because the padding on the K702s holds the speakers a little further away from the ear than the HD40s.  (The only problem with the HD40s is they were steadily falling apart...)"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These headphones are stunning. I needed a pair of reference headphones for studio mixing as my current situation has left me unable to use my monitor speakers. I am no audiophile, but I appreciate good quality sound and owned a number of 'hi-fi' headphones over the years but have never experienced such detailed reproduction of sound quite like these. After trying them out in the studio I noticed a lack of bass as others have said but after about 20 or so hours in, the bottom end is opening up nicely.... Either my ears are adjusting, or they really are 'burning in'!. I am currently running them through anything and everything to get more hours on them and after hooking them up to my ps4 controller, I think I have just found my perfect gaming headphones too! Playing The last of us remaster..uncharted 4 and alien isolation my mouth was wide open! I have to credit to the sound engineers and mixers of these games... The music, effects,ambience and dialog. With these headphones you are truly immersed in the game. Absolutely wonderful.\nThese headphones are also great with films and tv shows. Watching The OA on netflix with these on takes it to another level.\nThey are big,the cups go right over your ears and they are open backed adding to the airy,spacious sound these give. You can wear them for hours they are so comfy. I did actually forget I was wearing them a few times.\nI got them at a great price and am thinking of getting a second pair for gaming/movies.\nMy bro in law says hey I got these new 'beats' headphones, check them out.... Pshhh really? If overhyped bass,earache and bright colours are your thing then fine, but I'm sticking with these AKG's mate. The best headphones iv ever had."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"You won't find a better set of headphones for the money, the build quality is superb, sound separation is excellent and they put all the hyped up names out there to shame! Over the past few years I've tried two pairs of the Monster products, both from reputable dealers and both at extortionate prices. £150 for a set of over the ear clip on sports, £280 for Studios both falling apart with weeks and not just the in line volume controls but the headphones themselves made from cheap that.\nThe AKG 702's which came out some time before these now 'must haves' that our youth are now forcing their parents to buy them, these were not cheap but the price fell with the competition. The build of these are far better and as with all quality headphones they do need a good run in time allowing the electronics to acclimatise. They rest so comfortable on the head you can forget they are there and the sound in my view is in a league of there own within this price range. Regarding the bass on these a number of people have criticized them as having low or no bass at all, I feel again people have jumped on the bandwagon as I find the bass fine, saying that if you want to collect your pension using sign language maybe the bass isn't for you but I find it pretty good.\nAt the price these are now they are an absolute bargain, AKG have numerous followers in the pop and rock world including Eric Clapton, Peter Gabriel, Stevie Wonder, Aerosmith, the Rolling Stones, Rod Stewart, Anastacia and so on.\nFor less than £140 have the best and forget the rest!!!!!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"So long story short I bought these because I was tired of my old headset (Logitech G933) which is 7.1. They are an OK headset but they didn't deliver the sound accurately when I played FPS games, so I decided to spend a decent amount of money on headphones. And I did spend a LOT of time reading, watching etc around the web, which helped me chose these particular headphones. And I'm telling you...they are comfy the sound is amazing and accurate, I even tried putting some DNB tunes which I know like my backhand....well guess what... I heard sounds which I didn't even know exist. So trust me or not they are worth the price, just make sure you buy an AMP with them, because they do require a lot of power.\nP.S Will update the review in few months."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I like these. I'm using them to make music on with logic. I have a problem with a new neighbour , I have a expensive pair of PMC speakers , very detailed but due to my new neighbour I can barely use them , hence ... Some headphones. I read the reviews and went with these as they are cheap at 130. I do to music for the voice / big bro ' Americas got talent and like to think I know a good mixdown , it's prob my best skill. When I got them I played them immediately on a laptop and thought they were tinny and bass was low. I put a song on a loop for 4 hours with bass boosted at max volume with a sound card. and let them burn in , they sounded better afterwards . They are good because the panning is v evident with them , the highs are clear and bass is fine, if the bass were really strong like some headphones , ie pumping , your ears will get knackered after an hour , your eardrums can't handle it. My way of working is I make a track through the speakers of my 50 inch tv , then I move to a pair of monitors to check stuff then I use the headphones for the main part due to my neighbour prob, then I go back to the speakers to get it right. The headphones are comfy tho are heavier than a normal pair as they are huge , lot of sound bleed which is no prob as that's what they are for. They sound flat , ie not enhanced , you can spot stuff you can't on speakers and mine cost 3k and these are actually better, at least at low volumes you can. I couldn't do a track with these alone , but my process of making it for 5hrs on a tv then 5hrs on speakers then 25 on headphones for a track works well. I would recommend them for music making , kind of like the ns10 of headphones , I think if a headphone has been around a while then it's got to have something good about it . I like it when I see they were 400 and now only 130 , I've never owned pro headphones so please take my review as an uninformed one of headphones as I have never used 1k headphones, but in my opinion I'm very pleased with them and I imagine if I get used to them then I will stick to this model if this one ever fails."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These are excellent, they've become an integral part of my studio setup, and they're incredibly comfortable so they can be worn for hours. Now that AKG are owned by Samsung and have shut down their Vienna facility, these are probably the last AKG headphones you'll be able to get in this price range and of this quality. Do it."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is my first experience with true open back headphones so bare with me. I have used many sets of closed back headphones in the past and I've had great experiences with them, but these are on another level. First of all, you can hear yourself speak when you have them on. If you're using these with a PC and you're on voice chat, you know exactly how loud you are. Second of all, they sound like really good speakers with the punch of closed backs. Bass is clear and not overblown, same with the whole frequency range. Despite this, these are enjoyable for the causal listener as there is still a sensation of a punch with deep bass.\nThe only problem I've had is that they do leak enough sound to be picked up by my modmic 5 every so often, but that comes with the territory of open backs and these cans are good enough that I'm considering using a different mic to fix that problem over just getting equivalent closed backs."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"If your in the market for reference headphones these k702 won't disappoint, the price is outstanding as is the performance, even the packaging is sexy, I have hearing problems and have used headphones for many years, at all sorts of prices and manufacture, I can honestly say these are the best so far, delivering good mid and high range notes cleanly, with the bass not trying to knock your brains out, the design makes the k702s look real cool hangings on a cradle when not in use, the comfort level is excellent, the only minus point I can say is after several hours of continues use my ears get a little warm, due to the pads that do really fit well to the skull.\nSo like I said if your in the market for a set of reference headphones, give these ago.\nPs my nephew is really pissed, he is a professional drummer and has used AKG for studio sessions for years he purchased the same model when they first hit the market and paid  top  price."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These sound amazing right out of the box! Not too long ago, I would have thought they were a little lacking in bass. Now that my ear'oles have been educated, I very much prefer tight, natural, real bass. The bass from these headphones don't intrude into singing for example. Tony Bennett's voice was very clear and the 's' in words showed no sibilance. When I put on Beegie Adair trio and  \"A Time For Love\", the bass was lovely and the brushes on the drums sounded so nice. The ear cups are huge and even though my ears stick out like taxi doors, they still don't touch the inside. Until I get my Little Dot MkII headphone amp set up, the volume on my Ipad has to be at maximum but it is comfortable at that level anyway.\nI am thin on top so I need a head band to be comfy and this very nice leather one is very comfy. I listen to Spotify a lot while my wife watches the telly, so I'll be getting a lot of use out of these excellent headphones. I'm very glad I bought them now and I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"The sound signature was what I expected from looking up headphone vids. Slightly V shaped sound extra bass and Trebble but without washing out the Mids. Imagining is spot on. Just a tad loose if you like moving your head a lot. My only real concern is how long the plug connection is at the headphone end, it can catch your shoulder if you turn your head to the left. Sound slightly more exciting than dead flat for some and this is what I was looking for. Product arrived quickly, thanks!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Oh my goodness I am not lying when I say I have never heard music like this. I use these to produce. They provide a lovely flat and accurate response and it is so crystal clear. Stereo effects with these headphones on are next level. Honestly I hear things in tracks I've listened to for years that I've never heard with other headphones. I haven't owned many high end headphones in my life but these are by far the best headphones I have ever used. Can't recommend enough."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"I had originally given these a glowing review but sadly the right speaker stopped working after just 4 months. Fortunately AKG provides a 2 year warranty so I got to return them, and they were great while they worked, but obviously I can't recommend them now that they've failed after such a short period of time.\nMaybe I got unlucky, but for the price I would expect them to be far more robust."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Slightly underwhelmed by these, to be honest. I expected a lovely wide soundstage, but what I found was a decent soundstage. Also placement wasn't great either. They do have a greatly extended treble, and a slightly recessed bass. The main reason I returned them is that they really lacked dynamism, that is, the ability to really get behind music. I guess this is because they are really a reference headphone, rather than a music listening headphone per se. I now have the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 over-ears, which are portable, very dynamic, have a fairly narrow soundstage (but still good for a small closed back), a slightly rolled off treble (but with almost no sibilance!), and a slightly boosted bass. But despite the relative coloration of the sound, the Momentums win out with their incredible dynamism and their versatility as a headphone for music listening. They are wonderful. I also got them for £100. They tick all the boxes, where the K702s are more niche in terms of genre-pairing (instrumental stuff works best) and utility (firmly an at-home pair requiring good amplification)."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I wanted to upgrade my Audio-Technica ATH-M50's, good enough in their own right, but maybe I could do better. Having read all the reviews I selected Sennheiser HD 650's, because of their general positive endorsement and acclaim. Very disconcerted to find I didn't like them very much, though I tried to accommodate them and played them as much as I could, after all I had paid enough for them! But I couldn't stomach the low-mid colouration, which didn't get any better with usage, so I eventually had to sell them. I replaced them with AKG 701's, bought used to offset the money loss through the sale of the Senns - which gave me one advantage in not having to run the new phones in! I was completely satisfied on first trial: they are uncannily accurate, with extraordinary focus and definition, taking you right into the music as though you were part of it. An enormous increase in the pleasure of music. I see no point in listing all the treble-mid-bass characteristics, because if they are noticeable, the sound is not balanced, and it forces you to listen to the equipment rather than to the music. Good equipment offers you the music for you to enjoy and refrains from drawing attention to itself, and this is what the AKG's do, let you sit back and uncritically enjoy the music. (Provided, that is, they are linked with other decent equipment. You need an adequate DAC and amp, and if you have a high-impedence switch, use it: these phones need hard driving, otherwise they will sound restrained, however much you turn up the volume.) With all the right back-up equipment, the sound from these phones is as good as it gets. I don't feel that I need any better."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"I ordered these headphones almost a month ago, they were good, until the right earphone completely died. I must say I am super disappointed I payed £105, having had this problem with numerous other headphones. Just to have these conk out on me, left a bad taste in my mouth and left me severely disappointed, especially considering I've had AKG headphones in the past that were much cheaper and lasted 3 years."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"At around £140, these are a good sounding open-back headphone. My other pair are \n at £79. And I'll compare these 702s to those as a reference.\nBy comparison with the Grados, the K702s are heavier, but a bit less substantial. They are also significantly larger than the Grados, which makes them less easy to handle. The K702s cover the whole ear, and I found this lead to too warmth accumulating under the headphones. The Grados sit lightly on the ear. Sound, ultimately, is what matters. The Grados are very musical, so are the K702s. I'd give the edge to the Grados. The K702s I think have edge on ultimate clarity, lack of distortion, and control over the lower frequencies. I'd call it as an overall-draw depending on what you like to listen too."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"The high end on these is so crisp that when I flip back to my studio monitors I feel like I've gone slightly deaf :-). I have started to mix almost exclusively through them, occasionally checking the levels on my monitors. It's impossible to be truly objective and say that they are flat, but my mixes have drastically improved when listened to through car speakers, on my phone and  with other devices so I would say that they are definitely more accurate than what I am used to. The most notable improvement I've had has been with the bass elements of my mixes, which I'm guessing is because they don't colour the sound as much as what I've previously used.\nThey are reasonably well made, but I wasn't blown away by the build quality to be honest, after a few months of daily use they seem like they should last if your'e not transporting them around all the time. They are comfortable after you get used to them (I also wear glasses), but I don't notice I'm wearing them even after 2-3 hours.\nI don't have the cash for high end studio gear, but to be honest I would have no desire to upgrade these right now anyway, I think that they do a great job."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Extremely comfortable and fantastic sounding open backed headphone.\nThese have a very neutral sound with amazing levels of detail and clarity along with a very wide open sound that brings out massive amounts of detail to the point where you can hear every instrument down to the sound of the guitar string being plucked and piano key being struck.\nThese are very much indoor headphones and need a fair bit of power to get the best from them; don't expect to get the best from them using your mobile phone.\nLots of people complain about the lack of bass; it's true they are not bass heavy headphones but I think that the levels of bass are exactly where they are supposed to be."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Bought these back in October 16. They have been used extensively as I am a big gamer. Im not one for all these fancy headphones with lights and wireless rubbish that you really don't need. These headphones just give me what I'm looking for: Quality, comfort, versatility, lightweight and more.\nThe detachable wire on the headset allows for safe transportation, so nothing it damaged when putting it in your bag or case. The two plastic tube at the top are very flexible, allowing for varying head sizes. As well at that, the headband has 2 elastic strands each side, pulling the headband back down to its original position.\nThe actual sound quality is great, I've listened to my favourite band for over 10 years and even now when I listen to some of their songs, I'm amazed that I can still hear new sounds in familiar songs. I would recommend getting a DAC with these headphones, as personally for me, the base volume isn't as loud as i liked it to be - this is of course down to you and your specifications.\nI have had serious medical issues with the left side of my head, just around my ear in the past, so its unfair to judge against these headphones that after prolong use, I do suffer some minor pain here and there.\nI would say that the cable could be slightly longer, however, as I said before, it all depends on your setup and specifications. All around great headset, and would recommend it to
