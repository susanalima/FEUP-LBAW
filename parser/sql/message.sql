This thing feels absolutely sturdy and "expensive" from the get-go. It looks really sleek and I love the "bare metal" feel of not having a top cover over the keys. The feel of the keys is also excellent (and very much a personal preference thing). I went for the Brown keys that give you the fast switching but also some small amount of tactile feedback unlike the Cherry Reds.
I expected the keys to be louder than they actually are as I"m a heavy typer, but I was pleasantly surprised that they weren"t much louder than my previous keyboard with cheap non-Cherry keys.
One thing that will take a while to get used to however (why did they do this?) is that the keys with multiple symbols on have the "shift" symbol *below* the non-shifted symbol. For example, the "5" key has the "%" below the "5" making it look as if you need to press "shift" to get a "5". All other keyboards I have every owned and used are the other way around. There might be a really good reason for this, but it makes you have to really think about some symbols. The worst for me are the "[" and "]" keys. These keys are used with "shift" to produce "{" and "}" respectively. I used square and curly brackets a lot in programming, but these keys just look "wrong" with the square brackets above the curly variants. I suppose this is something I"ll get used to, but why do this in the first place?
One other small downside is that the USB passthrough requires a second USB port on your PC (the keyboard cable has two USB connectors on the end of it). I don"t know why the passthrough couldn"t have been achieved with a single connector as other keyboards manage. But this is a minor point as I say. It could be a major issue if you are low on spare USB ports however and want to use this feature.
Once I"ve used the keyboard and accompanying software more, I"ll update this review. But for now, I"m loving it except for the upside down keys! :)', '2018-05-30T17:32:52+01:00', '2', 'false', '1027', '150') ;

I"ve got to say the responsiveness of the Cherry Speed MX switches has actually improved my gameplay in Rainbow Six Siege and Battlefield 1.
I swapped out the WASD keys for the textured keys that come as extras with the keyboard (key replacement tool is included) and I can still type emails etc as normal on the keyboard with them fitted. The textured keys are also slightly sloped for ease of finger placement.  There are also additional textured Q E F R textured keys, of these I only installed the R for those essential speedy reloads.
The RGB lighting of the laptop is controlled by Corsairs CUE software. It"s a little clunky to use at first but after watching a few videos on YouTube I got to grips with it.  If you want to get the whole system up running fast, I recommend only watching how to import profiles from the Corsair website. There you can download profiles that will get some funky lighting effects running on your system ASAP so you can get back to gaming.  Once imported swapping between profiles in CUE is simply a matter of clicking on them.  The profiles are all encompassing, I also have Corsair Void Wireless headphones and an M65 mouse.

If you look at the HyperX Alloy Elite keyboard, you"ll notice how similar it is to this Corsair. And that"s just a single example, there are many more to choose this look and features. No wonder, it"s just that good.
Materials and build are the best that"s out there: sturdy aluminium case with nice brushed finish, wrist rest (67mm) with soft touch, dedicated potentiometer for convenient sound level control and media buttons to operate music player without leaving current game or app. All of those placed conveniently and without any risk of misclick. Also on front there is separate Windows lock and lighting buttons, while on the back USB 2.0 socket (my new favourite spot for flash drives) and lighting profiles switch. Do we even need any more buttons and switches than that? Of course not - it"s all already there!
Inside the keyboard we have top quality Cherry MX Switches, famous for their reliability and lifespan. They operate perfectly, despite what"s written throughout the web (Jitter? Where?!) The responsiveness is brilliant: you"ll never need to hit a button twice and you"ll never receive a doubled reaction after a single press.
Each-button-individual backlight instantly reminds that imagination is the only limit: while more complicated ideas can take while to configure, the results are breathtaking: 3 levels of brightness, 16,8 colors and set of predefined settings will switch your desk into a rave party ;) The software is intuitive and doesn"t put much strain on the OS.
Disadvantages? Only one and not really a big one - the connection cord is quite thick (7,2mm) and ends with two USB 2.0 plugs. So if you plan to move the keyboard a lot, this is something you won"t like at all. Otherwise, you won"t even notice this as a problem.
Summary: near perfect (why no leather on the wrist rest?) RGB keyobard with best switches on the market. The design, materials and performance impress and give you all you need to master your favourite games. Absolutely recommended.', '2018-08-30T17:32:52+01:00', '2', 'false', '1027', '439') ;

If you don"t have the software installed it defaults to red keys with WSAD white and arrow keys white.
The one thing I will say is I went for this keyboard expecting the keys to be silent or quieter then the norm... they are not... at all!  I"ve purchased some dampener rings which helps, but the loudness is just duller. I went for the corsair based on something I read about the keys being quiet, I quite clearly must have picked the wrong keyboard for silence, so that"s on me.  The keys are very responsive and don"t require to be pushed to the bottom as it says in the description... which may be one of the reasons it"s regarded as quiet, but you"d have to press all the keys very slowly in order to achieve that.
Overall very happy with what the keyboard does.  The shortcut features for media are good and having the roller for the volume is useful.  There is a button to switch the brightness of the lights, there are 3 light settings in total ranging from low, medium and high. One more press turns them off.  I"m currently typing this in the dark, I can see all the keys perfectly without having to turn on any additional lighting.  Great for gaming and ordinary use.

I previously owned a razer blackwidow 2012 with blue switches, which I thought was a prety good keyboard (got mine second hand for £45), but the K70 is in a completely different league!
I won"t go into how awesome this keyboard is as many of the other reviews already do this... (if you are concerned about the spacebar, I personally think it"s fine, what I would expect to be honest). What I will discuss is the MX switches.
Originally I ordered the keyboard with MX Brown switches (not RBG version as couldn"t justify the price for lights, which was the right choice for me), which were ok, but coming from Blue switches it just felt a bit flat. They kind of felt like driving an Audi (nothing against Audi), they are solid, reliable, smart and good all rounders (if you are one of those gaming vs typing). However, exchanging the keyboard for the blue switch version (which was a truly painless process, 1 day exchange!), is a bit like trading in an Audi A4 and exchanging it for a ferrari 448. This tingly feeling that I am getting whilst typing this review is just, INCREDIBLE!
Personally, I am absolutely delighted I switched the browns for the blues, and tbh, the noise is really not that differerent (it"s actually quiter than my Blackwidow) but if you are unsure, I would suggest trying both out and decide yourself.
P.S. Turns out the keyboard is also a great level. I thought the keyboard was wonky when setting it up on my desk but to my suprise it was my table suface!', '2018-12-28T17:32:52+00:00', '1', 'false', '1027', '324') ;

But before you tell me "you don"t know what you are talking about, razer it"s better, bla bla bla", let me tell you all the keyboards that I have owned.
For starters, I own currently K70 LUX with MX Speeds and STRAFE RGB with MX Silents. In addition to that, I recently was in the look for other keyboards and purchased/tested the Razer Huntsman Elite and the Roccat Vulcan 120 AIMO, but unfortunately both of them didn"t meet my expectation so I returned them. Furthermore, at one point I owned a STRAFE with MX Reds and a Razer Ornata Chroma "Mecha-Membrane" Keyboard.
Now, don"t get me wrong. All keyboards are nice and have their own good things. However, I will focus specifically on the "bad" things compared to this keyboard which make aaaaall the difference, and that is: rattling or wobbling of the keys, the height of keyboard in general and height of the key.
The huntsman elite is an absolute joke when it comes to rattling and key height. I also found it tremendously slow to spam for games fast paced games for example, perhaps because of that little tactile clicky bump (similar to blue switches) it has and this made me realize that I much prefer a linear performance on a switch indeed. It has nice colours and a very confortable wrist rest if you buy elite version but other than that, it was just a no go. The K70 MX Speed is just too sensitive in my opinion for some reason, possibly the fact that your hand must be really "curved" when typing on those super high keys. MX Reds and Silent are "meh" in my opinion. They just have nothing in special. The only possible keyboard I would say is a competitor of this one is the Roccat which also has a low profile. However, that keyboard is odd looking, it also has that little bump (in this case not clicky so similar to Cherry MX brown swithces) which again slows me down, and the wobbling of the keys is indeed much greater than the one I found in this one which is virtually ZERO.
Regarding this keyboard, I think it has THE absolute best feeling to type or game (for me) when compared to all of the others. And it is true what some people say that original MX Speeds where quite "sensitive" and you were prawn to making mistakes quite easily, but this is not the case with the low profile MX Speeds. They are AN ABSOLUTE DELIGHT TO TYPE ON!!! Trust me...
Now, that"s not to say that in addition to that, they do have lower travel distances which mean they are even faster both to actuate (1mm), and to bottom out (3.2mm), in case you are the kind of person that usually bottoms out the key when gaming or typing. This immediately gives you faster typing/gaming, and at the same time, it also gives you a better feeling because of the low profile, which is almost like typing in a laptop, but with a very premium feel to it. Moreover, this keyboard produces a more pleasant and quieter sound to the touch which I also think is an improvement since I want to be able to use this keyboard in my office. Finally, I think that the RGBs on this keyboard stand out more beautifully than any of the other keyboards, particularly Razer ones which I think are quite weak, and the only possible competitor again being the Roccat Vulcan 120 because of its fully exposed keycap. The Corsair logo lighting is just perfect, media keys and other extra buttons are delicious, and although I haven"t actually programmed any profile, I can imagine the 8M for onboard profile storage coming handy sometime soon.
Overall this keyboard is a must try! You won"t regret it. Even if this keyboard were to "fail" me somehow, I would return it and buy it again over and over until I get a good unit. And if for some reason it failed me and had to claim Warranty, I would still give it 4 stars at the very least. I understand that QC issues can happen, but when it comes to rating to overall product that Corsair development team envisioned, I give 10 out of 5 stars, really. Just perfect.

The overall build quality is much better than most mechanical keyboards on the market due to its very resilient back plate and frame less design. Which also makes it much easier to clean than your typical enclosed chassis keyboards. If you have compressed air at hand this process is made ever easier, but if you do not simply remove the key caps and take a vacuum to the surface to remove any crumbs/debris that have been caught while gaming.
Since i have two different types of switches my recommendations are as following:
Cherry MX Red for long use in gaming due to the slightly lighter required force to register the key press, this will ultimately reduce figure fatigue in those crucial moments as well as quicker key presses to ensure you"re playing as fast as you think you are.
Cherry MX Blues however i would suggest for anyone who personally enjoys the clicky sound  they give off when pressed. My other suggestion for the use of this keyboard would be people who do game but also spend large periods of time typing essays or reports on the same machine. The blue switches do give a much better typing experience overall.
I would however like to see an RGB version of this keyboard WITH Cherry MX Blue switches as i am yet to find one, but i wont deduct marks for this.', '2018-10-22T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '1027', '1008') ;
INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('9160', 'Firstly, I must say, the quality of the keyboard is excellent. I am a touch-typist, and have always had what I believe to be a relatively quick typing speed. Well, all other keyboards seem sludgy in my hands compared with this one. Key response is lightning fast, and I didn"t realise how much I"ve missed a mechanical keyboard!!
Back in days-gone-by, all keyboards were made in a similar way... to eventually be replaced by their "touch pad" equivalents of today. This keyboard is positively responsive and an absolute joy to type with.
Everything about this keyboard screams quality, I have the keys set to light up only when I type. This lights up for a brief amount of time and then fades slowly afterwards. Maybe not the best setting if you are in a public office and you"re constantly typing in passwords, but that doesn"t affect me. Another point to consider if you are in a public office is the noise the keyboard makes if you are typing constantly. The mechanical switches make the keyboard sound very "clacky". Again, not a problem in my home office, but something to consider if you do.
I"m not a massive gamer, although I still like to play Command & Conquer now and then. The keyboard offers me everything I need in order to play the game successfully, key action is so definite with it.
The only negative point I have is that the wrist rest a little inadequate. A rest is designed to support the wrists at a height so that your hands don"t bend upwards in order to strike the keys. This one really doesn"t support your wrists at all, so I have re-enlisted the help of a cheap gel-filled rest I purchased years ago. This isn"t enough to dock the keyboard itself a star, and the whole setup works fine for me.
I can"t imagine using another keyboard now, the rest seem so inadequate after this one. If you take the plunge with the money, you won"t be disappointed, trust me!', '2018-07-07T17:32:52+01:00', '0', 'false', '1027', '365') ;

and that fact you can change the w,a,s,d,e,r keys to grey to allow extra grip on the keys is tremendous in my opinion, second the keyboard is a good weight not heavy or too light but just right. The lighting is fantastic even though i purchased the none rgb version but because red is my favourite colour it was perfect for me as i don"t need any more colours.

Also this keyboard is extremely easy to clean with its large gaps.
However... i don’t know if this applies to others but ive ordered this keyboard twice as a replacement for damage on it when it arrived. Apart from the box being dusty i didnt see any problems even whilst wrapped in plastic. After i took that all of that off i noticed a weird sharp bump on the hand rest on the rubber. That was also present on the space bar and weird scratches and paint kind of peeled off on the logo. For a premium product i expect at least a premium finish. The damage seems to be a common issue on older versions of this keyboard but seeing it in a new version was surprising indeed. Most of the damage was surface level however and didnt hurt its ability to function correctly. Mostly visual damage.
Amazon support really helped me out with a ton of options of what i can do but liking the keyboard mechanicallly so much instead of taking a refund or a partial refund i opted to just get a replacement. Just be aware that your k70 may have some visual damage for unknown reasons.
Okay just editing my review since this is the third time i got this keyboard and it has surface damage to keyboards metal plate as well as on the wrist pad but ive come to ignore that. This time the reason i returned it was because of damage to the keys or just their HORRIBLE finish. The keys from the arrow keys and the f1 to f12 keys have this awfully rough side to their faces.

Also despite what other users say this keyboard is not especially easy to keep clean, though i can see the intent of the design, in reality, all it achieves is making the dirt that much more visible.
And of course what I"m about to say is true with any keyboard, but especially with this one: do not get any significant amount of water, not even a too-damp cloth anywhere near it, it seems to take water inside like a sponge. and once it"s there its pretty much game over.

MX Cherry red"s are a delight to use from both gaming and typing, lighting is generally good but better light dispersal in some of the key caps would be nice (this maybe achievable with custom key caps).
The software is convoluted and bulky to navigate through, but custom lighting options are easily downloaded from the community and installed.
Once you play around with the software it"s easy and reasonably quick to set customs keystrokes, macros, folder shortcuts and lighting options.
Being able to macro custom all the keys is a big plus and provides good modulation within games.

The lighting is decent (I have the plain red version) and the various modes available might be entertaining for some people. Palmrest is good size and you can change the angle of both the front and back of the keyboard, which is neat.
No setup issues, works fine through a USB3 dock, including the passthrough. The USB cables themselves are wrapped in a very heavy duty (but flexible) covering which I like.
Perhaps the only design decisions that I don"t like is the font on the keys, the fact that secondary characters (e.g. $) are not as bigthtly backlit (most likely due to a physical difference in the plastic on that part of the key).
You can set macros to any soft key, so even though my model did not come with the dedicated macro keys you can still get some use out of the software.

I really like the cherry MX red switches that it comes with, but i still have to install and try out the RGB programming settings. I am
most likely going to purchase some new keycaps. I still need to get used to the red switches, and the slightly smaller size compared to my
last keyboard, the Corsair K50 Raptor, which had 18 macro keys. This keyboard has none, but the numpad is easily modified for macros.
the wristrest is slightly too steep for me, much more comfortable than the last one however. If move the keyboard away from the table, it"s much mor comfortable to type. Moving it
closer to me reduces errors, however. This review was entierly typed on the keyboard, with the wristrest on and the feet extended. My last corsair keyboard lasted me at least 3 years,
after purchasing it second hand. I expect this one to last me even longer!

The Good:
It works perfectly on my duvet cover!! Meaning it will probably work on any surface, no mats required.
Windows recognised it and set it up instantly. I needed to tweak the settings a little for speed etc.
Nice big size, I hate those rubbish flat ones that Apple made fashionable at the expense of comfort.
It is very precise. I"ve used it on charts that my touchpad couldn"t handle with enough precision, this mouse sorted that out. Will probably work very well with CAD and photoshop type programs.
It has browser back and forward buttons.
No lag.
The not so good:
The scroll wheel does not smooth scroll unless you click the wheel first. Why?
The scroll wheel should be placed off centre as my index finger is off centre. Have mouse designers never thought of that?
The back and forward buttons were not placed ergonomically. They should have been more forward and wider.

*** Pro"s ***
- Has a very easy system of finding out which dpi setting you are on through the amount of flashes the led light gives off, this is extremely helpful as a lot of the time you lose the right dpi setting and cannot find it again
- Works really well for keeping your hand in an easy position without straining it
- The connection I had with the computer which was over 3 meters was perfect, without delay and acted as if it was a wired mouse
- The mouse is really easy to move on surfaces and feels natural
*** Con’s ***
- I always try and list a few cons in my reviews but this I could only manage to come up with one, that would be that the battery only takes 1 AA, I am yet for it to run out but I assume would not compare in battery life to a mouse with 2 batteries

There is only one thing that I don"t like neither understand about them which is why I removed one star. The swivelling ear-cups have 90 degree turn IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. As in, both ear-cups rotate inwards not outwards if you place your headphones with the Left-Right configuration suggested so you are not able to single-hear the ear-cups because they are rotated in the oppposite direction.
Of course this can be fixed by placing your headphones "inverted" (Right-Left on Left-Right ears) which feel exactly the same but now you have left-right sound inverted and given that I use them for playing video games as well, this kind of matters.
So, I really don"t know why they inverted the swivelling angle, perhaps because DJs have Left-Right in the opposite of the audience in a concert but I found it wierd and thats the only thing I don"t like about them.

For the red cable, the headphones will allow either end to plug into them, so you whether your device has a 6.3 or 3.5 you should be able to use the  cable the necessary way round, though I"ve only tried the 6.3mm plugged into the headphones and the 3.5mm into my PC/Phone.
The black cable (with the mic) for just music was fine, but when using the microphone for me was very crackly and the mic overly sensitive making it pretty unusable, just moving my head side to side caused crackling when looped back into my ears, and if you were using that for chat/phone/skype etc it"d be torture for the person you"re speaking to even if you can"t hear it (if you dont have mic monitoring on) so don"t expect to be able to the included mic... but for purely audio, you"re fine and I"m sure you"ll be happy with these headphones.', '2019-01-09T17:32:52+00:00', '0', 'false', '1072', '332') ;

My issue is with the build quality. They creak and crack just from being held, they feel quite loosely put together and when using them wired, even after only having them for a few weeks, one of the ears cuts out and can only be fixed by twisting the cable. I have tested this on multiple devices with multiple cables, one of which was purchased brand new and taken out of the box specifically to test them.
I previously purchased the OneOdio studio wired headphones and they felt much more sturdy than these, I understand compromises must be made in order to keep prices down, but I would prefer to pay a bit more to have sturdier headphones. These are bluetooth headphones, which means chances are they"ll be taken outside. These are nowhere near sturdy enough to be "Outside headphones". The entire housing is put together from cheap plastic and feels light and hollow.
While this might sound like a nitpick, I feel as though comfort is important when choosing headphones. Remember you might be wearing these for hours a day, but even if you aren"t, it"s good to have them be comfortable. The earcups on these headphones are thin and uncomfortable. I don"t have huge ears or a huge head, but the cups are made of a very soft material, which is fine on larger earcups like on their other headphones but on these it just causes them to mash down and feel like my head is against bare plastic. I would recommend swapping out the earcups if you do buy these, although I can"t recommend a replacement as I haven"t bought any.

Build quality is pretty decent for this price point, even tough some higher end models will feel less plastic, they do feel solid and durable. Pads are made of thick leatherette.

The detachable cable is a great idea, Any DJ will know the frustration of loosing those damn 1/4" adaptors.

Nevertheles, I was in need of a comfortable, more spatial and bassy pair of headphones, specially for working at my desk. The beyers sound amazing, but they feel somewhat uncomfortable after a few hours, because of the cheap build and the tightness. And, honestly, I was missing a fair amount of bass for my more "spectral" music. So I searched Amazon for something cheap, read some reviews and decided to go with the OneOdios. I"m really satisfied with them, as they are really comfortable for long listening sessions (though, if you use glasses like me, you"ll feel a little bit of crackling between the plastic and the earpads when moving your head, but not that much). They bring quite a lot of punch, with decent "vibration" and surround, although not that much as to outshine mids and highs. I listen to lots of ambient and drone music while working, and I find them to be really good at that, as they have decent isolation and the sound feels whole, deep and open: a relaxed sound that doesn"t get tiresome, but that"s not mudded either. It"s also really good that cables are intercheangable, and that it comes with two  (a DJ cable, for monitoring, and a standard one). Plastic feels a little bit cheap, but they work really well when in use, and I don"t feel that they will break when I put them on or inside my bagpack (it happens with my beyer). Again, I feel that they are comfortable, not too tight, and cozy over the head, thanks to the good headband. Oh, and if you don"t dig ambient music, I"ve tried them with pop and rock and they do the job just as well (but they are really bassy, as I said, or at least by my standards). I wouldn"t use them for walking whatsoever, only indoors, as they are BIG. I put them on my bagpack (carefully and on an empty pocket, as they don"t come with a case or bag... that would"ve been nice!) to bring them to the library, and use them there or at home. Haven"t tried them with anything that"s not music, like movies or videogames. Overall, excellent headphones for the price!

Unfortunately, I came under a lot of issues.
The first issue was a discrepancy between whether or not it"s exclusively Bluetooth or not. As we are provided with an adapter cable so it"s insinuated that it can be Wired headphones. But my experience was far from it.
Day 1: I knew from previous experiences Wired Headphones can be annoying when it comes to Audio Feedback Loops (basically when you speak into the microphone it causes an echo) and sure enough when I connected my headphones to my PC it immediately had a bad case of feedback loop happening.
After 2 hours I somehow managed to fix the issue (I feel half the blame lies on the headphones and the other half on Realtek a really quite terrible audio software which comes with Windows 10). I digress, So i fixed the issue and began playing TF2 for a few hours. I had a lot of fun, met some nice people; the works.
Day 2; I once again play some games confident the issue was gone. I play TF2 for about an hour when my friends begin to complain they can"t understand what I am saying. Sure enough, the Audio Feedback Loop happened again and it was torture. I tried fiddling with it for about 15 minutes trying to adjust the cables to the front (and back of my pc, as I have Audio Jacks at the back too hoping it could be a faulty jack on my rig) but nope. nothing I tried worked.
I gave up and connected the red cable directly to my Monitor so at least I could listen to the game, It continues having this weird ghostly back noise I still haven"t managed to fix.
Day 3: On Day three I was annoyed and committed to fixing this issue once and for all, after another 3 hours NOTHING. I adjusted the cables location, The audio settings, the microphone"s settings, I tried everything I could think of and it did jack diddly squat. I heard noises ranging from spooky ghosts humming, to grinding lasers, to Alien Space ships. you name it I heard all the weird noises.
I even found a spare Male to Male audio cable I had thinking that could finally fix the issue, and that maybe the red cable was damaged but no, even that didn"t fix the issue. I gave up and purchased the cheapest Bluetooth USB 4.0 adapter I could find on Amazon, which when including shipping cost me an additional €20.
Today:
Today my brother managed to source another 2 male: 1 female adapter we have at my house, a really old one. and I"m going to give it one last shot and see if I can change the cables out to resolve that issue.
Conclusion: Please don"t advertise your product as being Wired/Wireless and even provide customers with Cables to connect to PC"s (even including 2 male to female audio adapters) if when they try to use them, they don"t work or make their ears bleed. Just provide us with a Bluetooth adapter instead. (My only other final suspicion is the Microphone itself is damaged, but I have no way of testing this)
I"m still holding out hope that once I get the Bluetooth adapter the Headphones will work fine, but if not I"m gonna have to return these to you. They"re really nicely designed and when they did work I enjoyed them very much but it"s been 4 days now and nothing I"ve tried so far has worked.
I don"t want to rank it lower because technically when it did work, it did, in fact, sound fine and was good for gaming.
EDIT: 12/3/19  it"s garbage losing another star. i got the bluetooth adapter, set everything up properly and the audio quality is terrible sounds like an old nokia brick. I chatted to people online and they said the microphone sounded just as bad. The Headphones are awful and the microphone is awful.

Sound quality is excellent - the best headphones I have owned in my 59 years (versus SONY, SENNHEISSER, AKG and others) 2. Very comfortable 3. Very long battery life 4. They feel well built.
The one shortcoming is a "beep" in between tracks when playing albums. I contacted OneOdio and they were very helpful. Apparently it is a feature of bluetooth with iPhone users using iOS12 only. This is fine for pop music but affects the ambience for classical music - hence 4 stars rather than 5.
So I will use these headphones wired to listen to classical music. For the wireless functionality I have upgraded to these OneOdio headphones.

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('7932', 'First of all the system I purchased from ADMI is as follows: ADMI FR-1 Apex Legends Gaming PC: AMD Ryzen 2300X 4.0Ghz Quad Core, RX570 4GB Graphics Card, 8GB 2400MHz DDR4, 240GB SSD, Falcon Case, Windows 10, 300mbps Wifi.
As I was on quite a tight budget I spent quite a bit of time comparing and researching PCs and in the end decided that this system from ADMI was the very best system I could get for my money. I was originally going to go for the system with the AMD FX-850 processor because it is an 8 core CPU (over the Ryzen 2300X"s 4) however I later found out that it is an older CPU from 2012 and can only handle DDR3 RAM whereas the newer Ryzen 2300X processor can handle DDR4. I also wanted the default drive to be an SSD to ensure the fastest startup times for Windows, running software and games.
I ordered the PC on a Friday and it arrived the following Tuesday (2 days ahead of schedule).
The PC was extremely well packed, with the box containing the base unit being placed inside a larger box which contained shredded cardboard boxes as packaging. The various empty boxes for the components (GPU, RAM and motherboard) where also inside the package.
The base unit for the PC is large, well ventilated and the left side is made up of a clear plastic window so that you can see the interior. The base unit also contains additional slots for extra SSD/HDD drives. The RAM included RAM is 2 x 4GB of DDR4 RAM which I assume was cheaper for them to purchase than a single stick of 8GB DDR4 RAM.
The PC was basically plug and play, I had to do the standard initial Windows 10 setup and I downloaded the latest drivers for the Radeon RX570 GPU but apart from that everything worked fine from the get go.
I have not played any of the latest games on the PC yet as I mainly play Heroes & Generals (a free to play fps game) and Borderlands 2 however these games run exceptionally well on the highest settings.
I"ll mainly be using this PC for video editing and motion graphic design* and the processor & GPU work well with the Adobe Creative Cloud products that I use.  However if you intend to use it for this purpose and have the cash I suggest upgrading the RAM to at least 16GB as programs such as After Effects are heavily dependent on RAM (I looked up the specs for the Gigabyte A320M-H motherboard and they state that it can handle up to 32GB of RAM) and not just the GPU.
*On a side note the older Ray-Traced 3D renderer within After Effects only works with NVIDIA graphics cards, however the newer CINEMA 4D renderer IS compatible with AMD GPUs and since both renderers have similar functionality it has caused no major problems so far.
The only gripe I have is that the included wifi dongle was not very fast, it was OK for checking mail, websites etc but didn"t handle video well at all. Fortunately in my case I had a spare dongle which was of higher quality but I would rather that it was not included so that they could knock a few more quid off the price.
I"ve only had this PC for a few days now but have had no issues at all with it and think that it is an OUTSTANDING piece of kit for the price. In the future I"ll be adding more RAM and an extra SSD drive however the core specs of this budget PC are very solid and its a great platform to further build upon (I will also write an update at some point in the future to state how the PC is running after a few weeks/months of heavy use).
Overall I would like to thank ADMI for building such a great piece of kit which really helps out those of us who are on a tight budget but need to have a solid PC for gaming and creative software. Thank you!', '2018-05-31T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '1124', '134') ;

Vinyl as has been said was quite dirty/dusty. Also some strange swirl marks on the vinyl surface as if someone tried to polish and buff it up (with the sole of their shoes)! They are there for good I"m afraid.  Record itself is flat and although a few snaps and crackles plays fine. Volume has to be turned up its a very quiet pressing but then you get all the attendant hiss and background hum so its not a clean sound at all.  First side 22 minutes, second side 46 minutes.
Still after 25 years you can"t really expect Sony to bother to get it right can you!?
180g still don"t see the point apart from making the floor joists bend a bit more.
Overall happy to have a vinyl version of this great album as I didn"t get it first time around but as Sony don"t have to pay for recording a new album it would be nice if they could pay more attention to the actual quality and sonics of the pressing.
Well worth £9 of anyone"s money, unfortunately it cost a lot more than that!
 The CD sounds much better but its nice to have the vinyl.  Excuse my contradictory review.  Just played an original King Crimson LP from 1970 and its hugely better sonically and volume to background noise ratio as in there isn"t any.', '2018-12-25T17:32:52+00:00', '0', 'false', '1125', '592') ;

Great price for quality Vinyl music from a Band I knew a little about from a documentary I saw here in the United States.
I didn"t have the ability prior to technology such as ITunes , etc....
I"ve since ordered an amazing USB briefcase style turntable from the UK, and can"t wait for my pre order purchase of The The box set to arrive. Matt has been a favorite since 1983 , graduating from high school " Soul Mining " simply changed my life ! The way I viewed music and opened my mind and even made me realize that I don"t care if others "approve "of my taste in music , it"s personal  and Matt spoke what I was thinking loud n clear !
I can"t wait to visit England. Plan to travel there with my 9 year old daughter in the next 2 years. Waiting until we can afford to fly Virgin First Class  and stay 3 or 4 weeks.
I want to really experience London and the music and art scene as well as meet as many people as I can. I think people in England are simply nicest people I"ve ever been around. Gorgeous ladies with brilliant minds as well , and the guys are easy going and easy to share a pint with and I love hearing talk of life there , makes me wish I could live there ! It would be a dream come true. I"m a single Dad , 49 years old , soccer fan and Osborne being surname I"m sure my roots are there. I"ll pray about it , save money and further education in hopes of landing possibly a position for a few years and work , travel and afford my daughter the chance to see the world and not just South Carolina. If it"s God"s plan , we will achieve our goal , prayer and hard work us the key.
Best wishes to all who read this in UK. Look out Punk Rogers ( my nickname ) is coming to town. Have a pint and billiard table ready and let"s all have a great time !

 I remember listening to this album when it first came out and it totally blew my mind then, so now 22 years later on i decided to purchase the newly remastered version of The Stone Roses official debut release. I expect most people reading this review are familiar with the material here so i will give s short description of the remaster. The packaging is executed in a tasteful manner that keeps with the theme of the original artwork and photography presented in a gatefold cardboard sleeve. There is also booklet with additional photos and liner notes from John Robb, which put this seminal release into context. I must say that i was very impressed with the mastering here it is so good that it really captures the magic of the songs and although i have heard this album many times it sounds better than it ever did before. Fools Gold 9:53 is also included as a bonus and is very welcome in the eyes of a long term fan. I would like to see all the 12-inch singles released in this style too. All in all this is excellent reissue of an album that deserved to be remastered properly so top marks this release, if you are a fan buy it you wont regret it.', '2018-05-12T17:32:52+01:00', '2', 'false', '1125', '385') ;

However, as a number of other reviewers reported mine also ceased to work within a relatively short time. As I would expect at least a couple of years use from such a product I left a one star review  and was immediately contacted by the seller who very politely offered to send a replacement, which they quickly did. This impressed me especially as I should have made contact with them first in all fairness. (My bad)
However, this is supposed to be a product review and as such, though I"m impressed by the sellers response and give them 5 stars for their service and would happily deal with them again, it would give a false impression of the product. At this point I"ll raise the star rating to three as the two mice I have recieved feel very nice to use. But as yet I don"t have confidence that the second one will last.
I will revisit this review and ammend it if I feel it warrants it in due course.

This little gem not only quashes any worries of the past, but is probably the best mouse I"ve used (so far!)
So, I got looking for a replacement mouse, as a change to my setup meant that running cables (and hiding cables) just wasn"t a practical option. I also like to have plenty freedom of movement, without any worries of cables getting caught / snagged; so the obvious answer was to look at a proper wireless / cordless option.
Now, before I took the plunge on a "all the bells and whistles" option (knowing already that you can spend some serious monies on configuration "gaming" devices), I just did a skim through of the better reviews. Yes, I then was hit with a wave of doubt (skepticism?) when I saw the price (how could something that inexpensive live up to the job?) Well, it"s arrived, I"ve set it up (with no fuss at all) and I really am thinking that I wish I"d move to this mouse a long time ago.
Setup is very simple. You just plug in the Bluetooth dongle to your machine (it"s neatly tucked inside the battery compartment of the mouse, should you use this for travel). You pop a pair of "AA" batteries into the mouse (take note that they both orientate the same way, with matching terminals at the same end). You flick the switch (on/off), it"ll pair and, well, there was nothing else I needed to do...
Mouse movement is calibrated from my existing setup, so I had nothing to change. The button actions and scroll wheel are also spot on.
It"s a lighter movement, a nicer (lower profile) shape, comfortable and well, a joy to use. Yes, I"m rather pleased with it.

Logitech have changed the design - it is very similar but not the same. I have included a pic. I bought this because the layout was identical to my MacBook. Not any more! What a shame. Still a good keyboard, but not quite the gem I hoped it would be. In its favour - a LOT cheaper than the mac keyboard! I"m going to give it a go.
In summary: This is a great PC bluetooth keyboard that is also OK for mac.
* The enter key is now bigger. Not a major issue - its a bigger target than on the MacBook! The cost has been to displace the back slash key to the row below. Not a commonly used key for me.
* The key to the left of the number 1 is now the same as a PC keyboard and not a mac keyboard. For a mac it outputs § - not sure of the purpose of that.
* The key that was previously there has been moved to the left of the Z key. That key also now being like a PC keyboard. Make it much more difficult to toggle when used with cmd.
* The result of that move is to have the shift key on the left to shrink. Again - more typical of PC keyboard.
* (mac) option+3 = # (this is not printed on the keyboard.
+ Really well made. Much like all of the Logitech bluetooth keyboards I have encountered.
+ The "del" works like a PC del key - for a mac user that is very welcome.
+ Great rubber feet.
+ Bluetooth pairing is painless - unlike the previous Logitech keyboard that I owned.
+ Switching works REALLY well between my apple devices.
+ Nice key action.
- The circular keys take a little getting used to but I got there in the end. Still not 100% convinced by them.
- The greyed out mac commands on shared function keys are almost invisible.
- The power key on the left hand side rattles if you knock it. It is the loudest sound on this keyboard. I tend to rest my little finger there - so I do knock it from time to time. It"s a minor thing.
- No light on caps lock. It doesn"t activate the MacBook"s caps lock light either. But, again, a minor irritation.

Whenever I want to use it with other devices, I have to disconnect from the previous device it is connected.
This can be done but is very time consuming.
I am so delighted to find K380 which can be connected to up to 3 devices at the same time.
Three buttons on the left corner of the keyboard quickly changes the device it connects.
Key spacing and pressure is almost as same as Magic keyboard, which is great for people with small hands like myself.
The only difference is the angle. It is more flat than Magic keyboard.
I overcome this flatness by gluing a small felt pad for the furniture (see attached photoes).
I actually did the same thing for the Logitech touchpad T650 to make it same angle as Magic trackpad.
It worked great!
The added bonus was the extra friction from the felt pad gives more stability.

Although Logitech K380 is slightly more expensive than many other similar devices available on amazon, I found the Logitech K380 quality, lack of lag and ability to swiftly re-establish connection making it distinctly superior to the various other brands I have tried this far (Literally tried 7 other brands, each eventually displaying various issues including intermittent connection problems so were all evidently returned).
I am currently using this keyboard with my Macbook Pro 13 Retina (Mid 2014 model) under both OSX and Windows 7 (Bootcamp). The keyboard displays the ability to pair with 3 different bluetooth devices making it easy to switch between them using a simple press of either F1, F2 or F3 (buttons are yellow in the image).
I initially purchased the keyboard when writing up my final year dissertation project and needed a device that was as good and fast as the native built in keyboard on my macbook (with ofcourse lacking cables) allowing my macbook to be linked with an external monitor and for me to sit back in a relaxed position to type. The Logitech K380 lived up to my expectations.
Pros:
- Displays a high quality, well built feel.
- Easy to setup and use.
- Relatively small overall size but with a standard keyboard layout (similar to a macbook pro)
- Has the ability to connect and control up to 3 different bluetooth devices.
- Long battery life – Batteries are included! (Logitech claims up to 2 years – however I can confirm with high use, batteries still going strong after 6 months of use).
- Keyboard has built in sleep feature to save on power and appears to re-establish connection within 2-3 seconds.
Cons:
- Relatively more expensive than several other similar devices.
- Battery powered device (many other brands are now provide the ability to recharge the device).

Pros:
- Great size in a medium/small desk setting. I have average sized hands and it"s easy to speed type on.
- The keys have a satisfying conviction, and no wobble - so no mistyping at all.
- I can easily switch in a second between 3 devices. Easy to mix work and personal gadget typing quickly.
- Dual OS works flawlessly.
- Zero lag on either W10 or OSX.
- Solid weight + rubber feet, this thing won"t budge easily.
- All the function keys work on your phone (music play/pause/volume & Ringer level)
Cons:
- Not the most stylish keyboard, but the Matte grey is a nice colour if you have other "Space Grey" items.

My only gripe is that the choice of device is made using the first 3 function keys, which also have uses in an audio editing programme I use regularly. The button presses to access the F1-F3 functions are annoyingly cumbersome when trying to work fast - but it is a minor inconvenience.
As a design suggestion for the Mark2 version - I would suggest that Logitech leave the tiny LED light - above the button which denotes which device you are connected to - permanently on otherwise it is easy to forget and start typing into the wrong device.  The lights currently turn on when you select the new device but then turn off after 5 seconds.

I bought this particular keyboard because of the facility to pair with 3 devices and switch the keyboard between them by pressing a button, thereby eliminating the need to carry multiple keyboards with me when I travel.
Delivery was prompt and the keyboard arrived intact and well-packaged.
The keyboard has a satisfying weight and solid feel to it. Unlike some of the cheaper models I"ve bought in the past. Pairing with each of my devices was a breeze, and switching between them is fiendishly easy! it has "dual keys" which recognise the device you are paired with and functions accordingly (the grey symbols relate to Apple, the white to Microsoft/Android I believe). I"ve had no issues with this. The size of the keyboard, spacing of keys etc is compact, but not cramped. I have yet to have an issue mis-hitting keys because of their location.
it is on the pricey side, and I would have given it an even higher rating if it came with its own sleeve or cover (hence the 4, not 5 stars), however, my first impressions (I"ve only had it a few days) are that it will give me many years of service.

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('7018', 'My daughter has the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1-inch (2014 edition) tablet with which she uses "gesture typing" with the tablets Google keyboard touchscreen app (where you slide from character to character and lift up when the words complete). Plus she has the Note tablet"s bespoke 
 for rapid handwritten note-taking and tablet control. And she does type & write tablet words faster than I can type with this Logitech K380 keyboard. However she did get this Logitech K380 keyboard in 
 to try with her 10" tablet and we were both quite impressed with it. The keyboard works with PC"s as well, which can be handy as a remote if a Bluetooth enabled laptop is playing a movie in the distance. So when I purchased my large 13" 
 tablet I decided that this K380 keyboard would be a perfect functional compliment to the 13" screen tablet (and it is - it also looks good in dark grey and it was a few pounds cheaper than the blue coloured K380 as well). The keyboard was easily paired with my Yoga 2 Tablet, the Galaxy Note 10.1 and my Nexus 7 tablet (you can pair and remember three devices).  Once paired the keyboard just works when the tablet comes on - and that was surprisingly useful if like my daughter you have a long complicated password for your login screen (the alternative old style telephone keypad keyboard being particularly horrible to use). I didn"t think the lack of an inbuilt stand for the tablet was a problem as all our tablets have built in stands integrated into their official tablet cases or the tablet itself in the case of my Yoga 2 Pro. There"s no keyboard manual included but all the details (e.g. keyboard shortcuts) are on Logitech"s website as the "setup guide".
In use this K380 keyboard is naturally great for Office and internet chores, and in particular when editing number and text in Excel type spreadsheets within our Pro Office Suite Android app or editing text when you have the up/down left/right arrows and forward-delete. Plus of course it gives you a better view of the document screen when typing and editing a lot of text, as you don"t need the Android keyboard app overlaid on half of the screen. There"s eight double key shortcuts, e.g. Fn+C is copy, Fn+V is paste and Fn+X is cut. The top keys also function as media player controls where you can change track, adjust volume and mute sound at the touch of a button (sound control is the most useful as it means you don"t have to fumble with the tablet to press the volume control buttons). There"s also keys for menu, pause play, switch apps, home, and delete. And there"s the standard keyboard keys for things like tab, return, back-delete, shift, and cntrl, plus the normal four arrow directional keys. Both our tablets and my daughter"s Honor 6 smartphone run Android 4 (KitKat) and this keyboard works with Android 3 and above. There"s no click when you use the keyboard so it"ll be OK in lectures and meetings, although there is a slight tapping noise as you hit each key. The "laptop style" keyboard tile keys are fine with my large male hands and the keys seem positive enough (no miss-fires or doubles). Plus you naturally have the option of using the tablets touch screen in conjunction with the K380 keyboards character and navigation keys. With my 13" Yoga 2 Pro Tablet the whole setup has the feel of a large laptop without the weight (when used on a table/desk).
The keyboard has a rather stingy one year Logitech warranty and the batteries lasts "up to" 2 years (2 x AAA batteries supplied ready fitted). This K380 keyboard is far more useful than we thought it would be, and we can use it with our tablets as a remote control for media, so it sits around nearby ready to grab anytime when we are tableting. Overall it"s a hit and 4*, assuming it lasts a lot longer than the batteries. It"s not particularly light at 430g though, taking the combined tablet+keyboard weight to nearer 1.5 kg, but it is reasonably compact at 12.4 cm x 27.9 cm x 1.6cm for the backpack. Not an essential item for our tablets, but a useful addition none the less and my daughter now takes it to all her lectures. Plus it"s not too expensive at around £35. My daughters only complaints are that the keyboard is 3.5cm wider than her 10.1" tablet (so it looks ungainly with it - no problem with my 13" Yoga 2 Pro) and that she was taking the batteries out when it"s squashed into her carry bag/backpack, as it kept trying to pair with her tablet when she"s using it without the keyboard (we"ve since found the physical on/off switch on the side of the keyboard, so that"s no longer a problem). The Logitech keyboard packaging is such that it would be easy to repack the keyboard and return to Amazon for refund if you found you didn"t get on with it, provided you unpack it carefully. Logitech say the keyboard also works with Apple products like iPads, iPhones, PCs and the AppleTV. I"m very happy with this K380 keyboard, it only loses a star for the 1 year warranty although our blue version is over two years old now and still working fine.

I LOVE this keyboard so much. I can easily switch to different things like my Android phone and my pc. Because it uses Bluetooth over infrared I could even use it with my Amazon TV stick. No idea why more things don"t use Bluetooth - I specifically look for Bluetooth over anything else now.
The keyboard connects quickly as I"ve even used it right on the login screen when my other keyboard would take a good few mins to connect and then fail to connect.

I have now returned the keyboard due to the fact that this is not the same black as on the mouse, also, I"m not a big fan of the round keys.
Altogether, this is a good keyboard, its not a 32pounds keyboard however. I successfully replaced the keyboard now with a JETech one and although the last one comes at a third of a price I prefer it better than this one.

This is a great and well built keyboard which does not take away a lot of space on your desk when in use, is easy to store when it is not and has a great quality feel when typing. Initially, I had some trouble connecting the keyboard to my MacBook Pro. However, once I had it set up properly, it has been working perfectly.
How to Use:
The keyboard arrives with batteries. Pull out the little tab that separates the batteries from the connection points and the keyboard will turn on. Connect it to your laptop using the instructions in the box and you are done.
I did have some trouble connecting this to my MacBook. However, I believe this may have been due to me connecting an English keyboard to a German laptop. I have changed the keyboard settings in my MacBook to English (PC) and now it works perfectly fine with all keys mapped correctly.
Feel:
The keyboard is very sturdy as you would expect from Logitech. Typing feels great with a good response. The keyboard looks very stylish.

Im a developer and have been for over 7 years and as such i have been exposed to many keyboards at all price points and currently on my home desk i use a ANNE PRO v2 which is amazing as its a 60% keyboard but i have had to deal with the likes of razer, corsair, drevo, filco etc.
Now for this keyboard
It is amazing for burst typing. A lot of coding is entirely burst typing as you will be thinking then youll write some code or youll be ammending some code. You wont be writing essays when coding so its all good.
I have not tested this keyboard for really writing a whole bunch but the keys feel crisp and nice. The only caveat is that you will have to get used to the keys as they are round instead of square like most keyboards, however this should only take the first day to really get used to but then a week or so to be completely comfortable with touch typing as a worst case

When I say I use this all the time, it"s no exaggeration. I"ve given up using my PC altogether to write fiction on my tablet instead, and if it weren"t for this keyboard I don"t think I would"ve had that luxury.

By default, in Windows 10 the Fn keys operate shortcuts. For example, F1 to F3 switch pairing; F4 navigates the browser to the homepage; F5 switches between applications; etc. This behaviour can be annoying when it causes the keyboard to switch pairing when you are not expecting it; but thankfully it can be changed to the normal function key behaviours with a setting in the Logitech Options software.', '2019-03-13T17:32:52+00:00', '0', 'false', '1179', '456') ;

Yes, it may seem pricey for a small battery-powered keyboard, but the functionality is actually really great and it is very well built.
Positives:
- Small and easy to transport (but still a full-sized keyboard (sans number pad))
- Has some weight to it, so it won"t go skating around your desk when you"re furiously typing out angry Amazon reviews
- Connects in under 1 second one your device is registered
- Works for Apple and Windows, flawlessly
- Has a nice feel to it, and isn"t very loud when typing, but quite satisfying to listen to
Negatives:
- Once connected to my MacBook, not all of the F keys were working, they were unresponsive when I pressed them. This was an issue, as the F4 key brings me to my apps home screen, which I use frequently! I quickly found the "Logitech Options" app online and downloaded it to my MacBook, reset the keyboard to default for Mac, and boom, it worked! The problem was easily fixed, but not everyone would think to download this programme.
The only slight quarm I now have with the keyboard is that it can be confusing to know which symbols correspond to Mac and not to Windows. For example, the @ key is noted on two different keys on this keyboard, one in white, and one in light grey. Luckily for me, I am a touch-typist, so this isn"t a real issue as I know where it should be for my device, but if you cannot touch-type, this may take some getting used to.', '2018-11-22T17:32:52+00:00', '0', 'false', '1179', '628') ;

I bought it for use with a Windows PC (which already had a Bluetooth adapter - there isn"t one supplied so if you don"t have Bluetooth already you"ll need to purchase an adapter), but the ability to connect it to my iPad as well and swap between Windows and iPad at the press of a button is pretty useful as well.

I really like how the three dedicated pairing buttons work to quickly switch between devices - coincidentally I have just three devices which I use the keyboard with, therefore they each have a button. It works so seamlessly to change device that I am able to use the K380 interchangeably in quick time. The little power switch at the side is conveniently located for access also. The slant of the keyboard as it"s placed on a flat surface is just right for me personally. I also love the lightweight feel of it and it just looks good in this colour.
The keys feel great on my fingers - as a touch-typist this feel is quite important and is something I was slightly concerned about with the keys being circular shaped.

After reacquainting myself with the price of an Apple replacement I decided to quickly purchase a cheap replacement, for around £10. I quickly discovered this to be a mistake. The search then began to find a small bluetooth keyboard for my MacMini that was around £30 but had an impressive build quality. I was also looking for a recognised manufacturer that my MacMini would be able to most likely detect (the cheap keyboard I purchased wasn"t detected and there were no drivers etc on the website for it). This keyboard seemed to fit the bill.
Pros & Cons:
+ It"s slightly heavier than the Apple A1314 keyboard and together with the lower typing angle makes it feel like it is glued to my desk.
+ I like the feel and responsiveness of the keys, I can type faster with them than before.
+ It has has a large enter key (it takes up 2 lines).
+ It has a £ sign above the 3.
+ It has an extra delete key which functions like a delete key on a full PC keyboard.
+ "Logitech Options", a free download from the Logitech web site, adds additional customisable features such as on screen notification of when caps lock is on.
- Some of the Mac functions of keys are labelled in a grey, making them hard to read.
- The keys are circular and remind me of an old typewriter. This will not be to everyone"s taste and might take some settling in time. However, personally, I really like them.
- The fn keys are not the standard Apple A1314 layout. Instead of the regular functions above F1, F2 and F3 they are used for switching between devices. However, the functions such as volume and iTunes control work as expected and all the default keyboard shortcuts I regularly use work as expected too. "Logitech Options" allows you to make all F keys function as F keys and adds additional fn shortcut keys for Mac use.
- The ctrl and fn keys are switched around (compared to the Apple A1314 layout).
I highly recommend it and rank it up there with the Apple A1314 keyboard I previously had. I might even prefer it.', '2019-03-08T17:32:52+00:00', '2', 'false', '1179', '99') ;

However, asides from a few small things, I am really pleased with this one.
So first of all it is really nice to type on for me - it doesn"t feel as clunky as other keyboards I"ve used, I like the look of it, and while I was a bit unsure about the circular keys at first, I haven"t found them to be a problem at all. In fact, I think I prefer them. That said I do have small hands, so I imagine that this feels more natural to me because I"m no longer having to stretch for the keys. And one of the reasons I bought it was because of the size - my last keyboard made me type diagonally to the left which was uncomfortable and unhealthy, this one doesn"t.
However, sometimes it can be a pain to get to the keyboard to connect to whatever device you"re using. It usually connects just fine to my computer, mostly anyway, but it can be a little more finicky with my phone. I haven"t had a single time yet when it connects straight away and usually involves switching off the keyboard, switching off the phone, and spending a few minutes getting it to connect. But once the device is connected it stays that way.
Additionally there are two small problems that occur near the beginning of connection. Either the keyboard will lag slightly for a few seconds, or it"ll be overly sensitive for a few seconds, producing extra letters. But once it"s past those few seconds it works flawlessly, thus far.
The only other downside for me is that the keyboard doesn"t register as existing, for me, until my computer has fully loaded up.

the pc boots up in seconds, windows 10 on an ssd is great so so great, if you have this pc for work, you will have no issues, it can run a full office suit, email etc with 0 issues, (dont try gaming on it unless you have games from pre 2010, it has 128mb of vram so dont expect anything new apart from minecraft lol)
decent machine, easy to clean and maintain, bottom unscrews and clips off for easy access to motherboard and fan, has slots for extra memory and hard drive/ssd can easily be replaced with something else
the laptop does not  come with a disk drive so dont get it if you want to play CDs or DvDs, however a disk drive for the machine is not expensive or hard to get
word of advice, uninstall the Elan mouse drivers and use the generic windows drivers for the mousepad, the elan pointer drivers are super dodgy and have been plaguing me with screwed up right click, gestures and interactions going off at the wring times e.g moving the mouse around and suddenly it zooms in, pressing the right mouse button to right click and it performs a left click because my finger is in the wrong position it is just a hassle and not worth dealing with, these custom gestures and stuff are more annoying that useful

Fingerprint scanner - If you have a modern phone you"ll probably already appreciate why this is good.
Dedicated graphics - Not the most powerful in the world but it"s just enough to add a bit of bite to this device. Don"t expect to be playing the latest PC gaming titles on this.
SSD - It"s very snappy.
Battery - It has lasted me a full day of basic browsing and about 6 hours of web development.
Touchscreen - I don"t use it much but sometimes you just want to slide something with your finger and it"s suddlenly a nice to have.
Cons:
Trackpad - The trackpad can be hit or miss, get a bluetooth mouse. I wish I could take off half a star for this but since Amazon only works in whole stars, and I see more good than bad, I have to give it a pass.
Noteworthy:
Keyboard - The layout took a little getting used to, I think due to the size rather than layout but it is backlit and the keys feel good.

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('7108', 'I’ve thoroughly enjoyed testing this laptop. There are perhaps better ultraportables out there, notably the Dell XPS 13, but only if you have very deep pockets. This one from HP may not be perfect (nor is the Dell) but offers all most people will need. I love the Envy’s compact dimensions and especially its low weight – just a little over 1.2 kgs.
The first thing you notice, on unboxing, is the very smart cast aluminium body. Open it up and the screen has Gorilla glass side-to-side and top-to-bottom. There are bezels around the display, under the glass, but it still looks classy. This is an elegant laptop.
Performance-wise, with its i5-8250U processor, few people will want more. It’seven capable of light gaming, given the on-board GeForce MX150 graphics card. The fan only kicks in under heavy load, so the machine is quiet, most of the time.
The memory is soldered in place, so can’t be upgraded, but 8 GB is all you really need. The 256GB SSD is too small for anyone with a collection of photos and music, let alone videos. It can be swapped, as long as you’re confident and read the Maintenance and Service Guide (available, along with the User Guide, on the HP website), but you"ll invalidate the warranty in the process.
The 1920x1080 display is sharp. Brightness could be greater for use outdoors but is no problem otherwise. I’m not sure the colours are quite 100% accurate, so this may not be a machine for enthusiast photo/video editors. On the plus side, it offers multi-touch – very useful. For general use, including movie watching and casual photo/video editing, no one is likely to complain about the display.
The keyboard is excellent, with nicely spaced keys and good feedback. Opening the display makes the keyboard tip forward a little, to make typing more comfortable. I was delighted to find that there are dedicated keys for things like PrtSc, PgUp, PgDn, Home and End – no need to use the Fn key. I wish the Enter key were bigger but I’ll get used to it. The fingerprint key, unusually, is on the right side of the machine instead of the keyboard, but it works well.
The touchpad is accurate and responsive. There’s no Microsoft Precision support, so you don’t get the full range of gestures, but few users will be bothered. The speakers are impressive for a laptop of this size but inevitably lack a little bass..
Battery life doesn’t match the claims but, with light use, will see you through a full day. You need to carry the charger for more-intensive use, but at least it’s pretty quick to charge (they’re not wrong when they claim charging to 50% in 45 minutes, but it does then slow down).
There’s a pretty good selection of ports. The single USB-C port is non-Thunderbolt, if that matters to you. The two USB-A 3.1 ports are welcome. Then there’s Displayport, headphone/mic, micro-SD, and charge. A USB-C to HDMI adapter is included in the box. I’ll miss full-size SD, and a second USB-C would have been welcome, but otherwise I’m happy. It’s easy enough to buy adapters for SD and Ethernet, if you need them. At my desk, I use a USB-C hub that gives me Ethernet, HDMI, SD and extra USB-A and USB-C ports.
I’ve deliberately picked out this laptop’s imperfections but in fact it represents something of an Ultraportable bargain, at less than £850. I’m delighted with the Envy and strongly recommend it.', '2019-04-01T17:32:52+01:00', '2', 'false', '1376', '308') ;
INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('7109', 'I"m reviewing this sort of on behalf of my 65-year-old dad, who is just about computer savvy but definitely uses a computer in ways I wouldn"t. Im all video editing, connectivity, downloading, music production programs....he"s more about an easy life. He"s the type to read spam email and passes time on it by playing solitaire. We"ve gone through a fair few laptops for various reasons - too heavy, too big, too slow, doesn"t work...just to paint a picture of what type of person this laptop needs to please in this instance!
So actually, reviewing it for him and not me, i"m actually really impressed with it.
It almost seems, in size and design certainly, like a small Macbook, but for those who want a Windows system.
There"s a lot I could say about Windows 10 but i"ll leave that out completely. Focusing on the laptop...
So as I said, if I was using it, i"d want something more - but like everything, you have to weigh up your uses to determine appropriation.
The screen is fantastically clear. It"s like the TV section of John Lewis with the ultra 4K clarity. In regards to watching programs on it, they"ll always suffer poor internet connection buffering so you might not get a program that matches the photo sharpness of it, but it"s ideal for my dad with poor eyesight to have it this sharp and clear.
Another favourite thing on the physical side is that they"re nice big keys, nice big keys for nice big fingers. The touch screen is useful though thankfully HP haven"t relied on it being the sole usage point - you can completely get away with not using it at all - again for the likes of my dad who shuns the whole touchscreen fiasco, a "generational thing".
Lightweight, portable, fits in most bags. Another win. Most of his usage is internet browsing, downloading unusual programs like TomTom updater and Google Earth, and the odd use of Excel if he"s working away. The most important things for him were strong internet connectivity, and to be honest, just ease of use. The 8gb RAM is more than enough as he"s not doing anything processor heavy like rendering on photoshop or making videos, it"s all low to medium CPU stuff like Word, Excel, Chrome, Spotify...even with all of them open at the same time, no struggles at all. It boots up fast if you leave everything open and just close the lid, and now that i"ve set up fingerprint security for him, he"s thankful for not having the "pain" of remembering passwords anymore.
The 256GB memory again, is suitable for purpose. It wouldn"t even bother me too much as I run most things off hard drives and use the computer as a component base, but even for my dad, it"s more than enough for files, photos, the odd video, heaps of random manuals downloaded off the internet. I think generally this laptop would struggle if you were considering gaming, but for nearly all other applications outside of games, video editing and music production, it should be fine.
The lack of ports that all laptops seem to be having these days is somewhat annoying, my only downfall on this is the one USB port, another would have been really useful. It has a Type-C port but my problem with the lack of anything is that the adapters are really annoying to carry round and not lose, even more so considering Type-C adapters can be pricey. You now need an adapter for everything these days because they just won"t build them in to the laptops. So another USB would have been nice, but...it"s really only one downfall.
There"s also no disc drive. Again, old hat technology that also takes up a lot of space in the innards and hence why they don"t put them in anymore, but sometimes I think the one benefit of laptops and computers over tablets or phones is that it"s got a disc drive. Software updates, DVD"s then routed in to a TV, personalised photo slideshows...there"s a lot some people still use discs for. It"s a shame really.
Some thoughts:
Like all Lithium batteries, they have a memory, so the best practice with them is to fully charge for the very first time, then let them completely drain each time before recharging - batteries have a "memory" so if you recharge when it"s on 35%, it"ll remember being empty at around that if done enough times.
I"d recommend a screen protector, the UHD screen is much like the modern Apple iPhone screens - wonderful, but smash easily. I"ve just got a hunch. And unlike iPhones, I imagine this £800 laptop probably isn"t as easy or cheap to get screen repaired.
Overall, fantastic. I think it"s designed as an everyday all-rounder, and as long as it"s seen as that, I think it"s brilliant. Travels easy, holds it"s battery power, connects easily, works.', '2018-10-08T17:32:52+01:00', '0', 'false', '1376', '665') ;

Start up is fast and the touch screen is great if you"re feeling a bit lazy. I haven"t really done much else on it but I am very happy with my purchase, its fast, its lightweight and it has all of the little features that make it easy to use (backlit keyboard, good webcam, fingerprint scanner, touchscreen etc).', '2018-05-12T17:32:52+01:00', '2', 'false', '1376', '412') ;
INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('7111', 'This is a really lightweight and compact laptop. It"s a step above the netbooks that was all the rage several years ago. It"s got a slightly bigger screen size than the netbooks, but is thinner and lighter. The size, look and feel is almost comparable to the smaller MacBooks. It"s perfect for home use, accounting, storing photos, writing documents, managing emails, watching movies. With a medium grade processor and SSD it boots up very quickly, considering it"s running the latest Windows Home Operating System. The hardware specification is comparable to a basic desktop PC, so it has enough resources to install most home/accounting/office software, and all packed into one portable device. From new the battery charges quickly and the charger is slim, so makes the laptop even more portable. The build in the hardware is what really sells this laptop, the keyboard is soft, low profile with subtle feedback. The speakers are Bang & Olufsen and have a very good audio output. The laptop also has a camera built into the top of the screen, it does struggle in low light but is sufficient for use with video messaging. The screen has a glossy reflective finish, and displays photos, graphics and colours with satisfying brightness, crispness and high saturation. The screen is touch capacitive, and does unfortunately attract greasy fingerprints. The fingerprint reader takes some getting used to and is less receptive compared to other devices I"ve used. Initial set up with Windows 10 has its flaws, but the operating software is not what this review is about. A quirk with this design is that the back of the screen, serves as an elevation point for the laptop when fully opened. I feel this may look edgy but could compromise the opening mechanism after much use. The specification of this laptop is more than enough for home and leisure use, the build and quality of the components is what makes the laptop feels superior to the lower end models.', '2018-05-29T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '1376', '1115') ;

PERFORMANCE:
In terms of gaming, I have no complaints. I game lightly (SIMS 4 and Football Manager 2019) and have no issues with lag at all. Both games run at close to or on 60 fps.
BUILD:
The build quality is superb. Metal, lovely corners, nice tree-like design panel on the back, thin, portable. Has that ergonomic design so it tilts when opened for easier desk use. Love it.
DISPLAY:
The screen is nice, perhaps could be a little brighter outside, but inside it"s never an issue. Crisp imagery and good colours when gaming/watching videos. Small bezels around it make it seem minimalistic. It"s not a MAJOR feature but it"s more than good.
USER EXPERIENCE:
Runs Windows 10 like a dream and the touchscreen is something I never thought I needed, until I had it. Now I can"t go without it and feel at a loss on my desktop PC. So convenient.
BATTERY:
Excellent when operating daily, 5-7 hours dependant on what you"re doing. When gaming consistently I achieved around 3-3.5 hours before low battery warning. It charges extremely quickly, from low to full in just over an hour.
OVERALL:
I would highly recommend, from my research the Envy 13 is pretty much the best bang for your buck ultrabook out there.', '2018-08-17T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '1376', '56') ;
INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('7113', 'I"ve always been a fan of HP"s laptops but they haven"t always got things right when it comes to design.  The Envy 13 ah0001na and ah0501sa (both the same laptop) has pretty much got things perfect.
The body isn"t a unibody like some of Apple"s macbooks but it"s close enough.  An aluminium body immediately makes this look premium and when you open the laptop up, you get the base of the screen acting as a foot, lifting the base so that it can gain extra air ventilation.  In short, it looks great closed or open and only weighs around 1.3kg, so light to carry around.
The keyboard is silver to match the case and is backlit, though the backlighting is white which does make it a little more difficult to see individual keys in certain light.  The keys feel good and are responsive, though there is a small sponginess to the centre of the keyboard.  The trackpad is also responsive and multitouch works well in Windows 10.
Inside you have a fast 8th Generation i5 processor which is pretty much all you should need for powerful processing, plus 8GB low power DDR3 RAM. I would have preferred DDR4 but this is still fast enough for a small laptop.  The star of the show is the MX150 Graphics Card, though. which is around the equivalent of a desktop GTX1030 or just less.  It can play recent games like Far Cry 5 and Tomb Raider in 720p at a minimum of 30fps and older games in 1080p.  Even Forza Horizon 4 ran smoothly at low quality on the laptop.
The screen is full HD, has good viewing angles and the panel has some nice strong colours and deep blacks. Overall the picture is very clear.  Watching videos is great while on the move, though the gorilla glass does reflect light a little too much at times.  It"s also a touchscreen, though doesn"t have support for pens, but it"s a nice touch that comes in useful at times when you need to scroll or draw a circle around a piece of work.
The 256GB SSD is really fast, loading into Windows is almost instant when you switch on and it"s a joy to use with games and apps.  There are also 2 USB 3 ports which are the half hidden type and a USB C which is the fastest you can get and supports video out to TV or monitor. There"s a fingerprint sensor on the side next to the USB ports, too, which seems to be fairly accurate, though took a little getting used to in that position.  Battery life is also surprisingly long, 9 hours for productivity work without adding gaming, which is amazing these days for a decent laptop.
On first turning on the laptop you"re taken through the Windows 10 setup with voice control turned on, which was a nice surprise.  HP have included several full apps which are included on the hard drive including Cyberlink Powerdirector and Photodirector and you can choose to include them or turn them off,  as well as Microsoft Office installed by default.
I"ve been using this laptop for a few weeks now and it"s pretty wonderful.  Comfy on the lap and good to use on a desk, it can fit in a small bag and is light enough to carry around. It"s been fast to start up and has never struggled with apps, I"ve even been playing the new Far Cry on it quite happily for a few hours.  I"m extremely happy with this device and full marks to HP for their design.', '2019-03-28T17:32:52+00:00', '0', 'false', '1376', '380') ;

You"ll need to download the Logitech Setpoint software if you want to be able to identify Num Lock and Caps Lock status (via on-screen overlay), as the keyboard features no status indicators, presumably to extend battery life. The software also enables some keyboard shortcut and mouse customisation, which you may appreciate.', '2018-10-28T17:32:52+00:00', '0', 'false', '1386', '644') ;
INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('7139', 'I received this combo set from Amazon EU three days before forecast, so that was a nice surprise. And so far, it has lived up to its promise. I bought it to replace a corded keyboard which had become increasingly unreliable & the fact that it"s cordless is a surprising bonus.
The keys are noticeably quieter than the previous one, the very large backspace ( & mysteriously, another spare one on the top right, in case you forget where the main one is, presumably) & delete keys are also nice, as I make a lot of typos as I type quite fast. It also has the dinky little fold-out feet at the back to angle it, with rubber bumpers on the lower bit, so it doesn"t slide about on the desktop & comes with batteries pre-installed.
It has a predominantly matte surface, so not the dust & fingerprint magnet my previous one was. The calculator key is very useful, as are the alternate function keys, actuated by pushing the blue "fn" key. One slight niggle is that the silver media keys at the top don"t have very distinct symbols on them, making it slightly difficult to see their function. One of these completely shuts down your pc with one button press: very handy.
Oddly, it doesn"t have Caps Lock or Num Lock leds, but a small screen advice notice appears when you activate them, & who doesn"t always have Num Lock On?
The quiet & discrete action of the keys is also very positive for a cheap membrane keyboard (as opposed to the more expensive mechanical ones) & overall & it"s quite a bit smaller dimension-wise than the monstrous gaming keyboard it"s replaced. The handy thing about having a cordless keyboard is that you can just pick it up & place it aside if you actually feel the need to write something on paper on your desktop, or eat a meal. OK, I was joking about that last bit, as I"m not that desperate or slobbish & I have a table in the dining room to eat meals from. But you know what I mean. Quickly frees up deskspace.
It claims very long battery life but I haven"t had it long enough to test the 24 month claim. Anyway, for the particularly frugal, it has an on/off switch underneath. I"m very pleased with it, & at the current Amazon price, it"s a winner by my standards.
Now, the mouse......
I didn"t need another mouse as I have an ancient cordless Logitech M510 using a similar tiny USB dongle in one of the pc"s front USB ports, so expected it to work immediately, along with the keyboard, as it"s got the Logitech Unifying software previously installed. Alas, the new (tiny) dongle, which looks identical to my old one, didn"t work with my old M510, which is perfectly weighted, big, tall, sophisticated (much like me) & perfectly suited to my hand & loads better than the cordless M215 which comes bundled with this combo.
Compared to the M215 my old M510 is a Rolls Royce, so I was momentarily dispirited.
The M215 which comes bundled is quite small, has no left-hand back/forward browser buttons, no left/right scroll function on the scroll wheel, & is, if I put it delicately, is more suitable for a smaller female hand than mine & is much less sophisticated than the M510 & makes a scratchy noise on my Fellowes gel-pad mouse mat, which the M510 doesn"t. It"s a piece of c**p frankly. But OK for a lady or a dwarf. Not a Man"s Mouse.
BUT.......
I got on the Logitech site/support  & updated the Unifying Software, switched off the 510 then on again & Bingo! It instantly recognised it & worked, as the Unifying software recognised the 510 after specifying it in the simple menu. You can run up to six Logitech unifying peripherals from the same dongle, so that might be helpful to people who have other cherished Logitech input products like me. However, my M510 cost more than this keyboard/mouse combo combined.
The supplied M215 might be small & light so more suitable for use with a laptop & at least I"ve got a spare mouse in case my M510 goes kaput (unlikely).
All in all, 5 stars for the keyboard, at its price point, but missed 5 stars due to the patheticness of the mouse in this combo. But if you"re not too fussy about mice, disregard this.
All in all, typical Logitech quality & build, & for a membrane keyboard, this is good enough for me. Recommended.', '2019-01-04T17:32:52+00:00', '2', 'false', '1386', '750') ;

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('8698', 'I am using the Beelink S1 as a Linux Mint 64-bit powered home server, to serve files, a VPN and as a personal cloud file sync solution, among other things. Before buying it I had been using my power-hungry, twelve-year-old desktop PC - an Intel Core 2 Quad based machine.  I chose to migrate this server set-up to the Beelink S1 because, according to various different benchmarks, it has around the same amount of computing power as my old desktop but uses only a fraction of the electrical power (around 18W vs around 300W).
Inside the box, accompanying the Beelink S1, is a UK 3-pin power adapter-in-a-plug, two HDMI cables (measuring 15cm and 60cm), a mounting bracket and screws, a warranty card and a basic cable set-up guide.
The Beelink S1 has a quality "feel" in the hand and was quickly and easy attached to to the rear of the monitor, using the supplied mounting bracket and screws.
Because I knew that my memory usage would be very light, I chose the version with 4GB RAM. The internal 64GB eMMC drive comes with four partitions:
- EFI (100MB, 50MB used)
- Windows Boot (128MB)
- Windows (57GB, 12GB used), and
- Windows Recovery (822MB, 492MB used)
Migration to Windows 10 Home Edition was not an option because I needed RAID support, but Microsoft only supply RAID software with Windows Server editions, therefore once again I needed to use Linux. Rather than wipe the supplied eMMC drive, I unscrewed the two pozi-drive screws at the base and popped in the 128GB Toshiba SSD from the old desktop, which the Beelink recognised straight away.
Pressing F7 during the power on sequence allows the boot device to be changed on a one-off basis, while using ESC allows access to the firmware. In the firmware I was able to set the Beelink to permanently boot from a USB stick in the first instance, followed by the SSD, then the eMMC.
Installing the Linux Mint v18.3 64-bit distribution was not easy because - although the Beelink is capable of running a 64-bit OS - it has a 32-bit EFI system: That means the choice is between either installing a 32-bit Linux system using an out-of-the-box ISO, or making a custom 64-bit ISO using the ISORespin shell script, available at the Linuxium web site. Because I wanted a 64-bit OS and not being one for the easy option, I chose the 64-bit install using ISORespin, and it was not too long before I was able to boot a respun 64-bit Linux Mint v18.3 ISO from a USB stick.
During the install there was a bug that prevented the GRUB bootloader from working. That was worked around as follows:
- Boot from the USB Stick
- chroot to the installed system
- Install the rEFInd PPA and package (available on Launchpad)
- Reboot without the USB stick & choose "Linux with minimal options" at the rEFInd menu
- Once booted, amend the rEFInd menu file, at: /boot/refind_linux.conf
Perhaps if Linux Mint is installed from a portable DVD player rather than from a USB stick, it may "just work". In any case, YMMV.
With a working Linux Mint v18.3 on the SSD, I found that most of the hardware "just worked" out-of-the-box: That is,
- Wi-Fi (both 2.5GHz and 5.8GHz work but full "ac" speed was not tested)
- Bluetooth (devices can be recognised and paired)
- Graphics (nice!)
- Gigabit Ethernet
- USB3
- USB2
- HDMI
- SD slot
- SVGA
- The earphone socket takes a combined earphone/microphone plug, such as those for mobile phones, and both functions work perfectly.
- The built in microphone, however, does not work at all. It shows as "unplugged" in the Pulse Audio control.
- There is no option in BIOS to restore to the last power state, meaning that if there"s a power dip the unit will not return to a powered on condition, and Wake On LAN won"t work because the network interface is unpowered.
- I attached a wireless USB2 keyboard & mouse adapter to the unit and both "just worked."
- My RAID disks were correctly recognised by Linux when they were attached from their shiny new JBOD unit via USB3, and the performance is good. However plugging in a further external USB3 Drive caused a USB power dip, causing the JBOD unit to reset and reattach the disks with different IDs. A powered USB3 Hub attached to the second USB3 port of the Beelink easily solved that problem.
The Beelink is running 24/7 and the case feels slightly warm to the touch. The "sensors" command shows that the CPU Core runs at ~40C when idle (with 2.5% to 5% CPU usage) and under a sustained load over a twenty minute period it topped-out at ~65C: No great issue for a processor designed for operation up to 105C. Memory usage is around 750MB at idle, so there"s plenty remaining.
Thus far the tiny machine has been very stable and has easily handled all of the tasks that I wanted it to do.
Overall, I am very pleased with the Beelink S1 and I"d definitely recommend it, certainly in this particular role as a Linux based home server.', '2018-05-30T17:32:52+01:00', '0', 'false', '1388', '785') ;

I have used it to watch YouTube videos, stream movies and internet browsing. There seems to be a significant time lag - probably due to the processor not being quick enough. Some examples: When typing letters sometimes it can take up to 7/8 seconds for each letter to appear. This happens intermittently. Videos can take time to load on youtube and when streaming and some get stuck when buffering. Even when switching between tabs on internet explorer there is a very small time lag after pressing the button before the page comes up (this doesn"t really bother me but is just being used as an example to illustrate the lack of power of the processor).
I think Windows 10 is possibly taking up too much of the processors power.

This is a very representative collection of a top group of the top 60"s. With 50 tracks for less than £10 it is a bargain.
My experience is that collection issues are usually unrepresentative of the the work of the artists involved. That is not the case here, probably because the Small Faces was a relatively short-lived group issuing 4 albums and about 15 singles in the period 1966 to 1968 (excluding the "reformed" group"s 2 albums in 1977 and 1978). Steve Marriott as lead singer and guitarist was the mainstay of the group.
They were best known for their singles and their most well-known album is (probably) Ogdens Nut Gone Flake. When this was originally issued it came in an oversize tobacco tin (large enough for the 12" vinyl). I never owned this at the time, but in the last few years was put this on my wish list for Christmas and received a CD as a present - see my separate review of that.
The compiler"s of the Ultimate Collection for the Small Faces did not have a huge collection of tracks from which to make their selection, so it was probably more a case of choosing what NOT to include. The result is very good. The singles (which were repeated on albums anyway) are included, together with album tracks including the best parts of Ogdens Nut Gone Flake (without Mr. Unwin, and with good equalisation).', '2018-12-15T17:32:52+00:00', '1', 'false', '1618', '358') ;

It has a standard UK layout, hotkeys and function keys alongside arrow keys and a numpad (all in standard positions).
As it"s a USB keyboard, you simply need to plug it in (no batteries, just one wire you plug into the USB port on your computer). It was very fast to get set up. Your computer should quickly recognise that a new device has been plugged in and you should be able to use it right away. This all worked perfectly, and I was able to get going quickly.
The keys are not clunky and noisy like some keyboards, but instead feel much more distinguished and soft. There is still some noise though, so if you like a whisper-quiet keyboard, this may not be for you.
I have large hands and my partner has small hands; we are both happily able to use this keyboard without any problems. There is ample gap in between each key to avoid hitting multiple keys when typing at speed, and the spacing is very very similar to the Microsoft keyboard this was bought to replace - so re-learning the key positions was not necessary.
PRO:
The hotkeys work with my Windows 10 machine.
Nice, slightly curved, profile allows for a small rake to the keys which helps to pick them out.
Seems very sturdy and advertises spill-resistance - which I believe is true.
Rear stands to adjust the angle of the keyboard up to around 4.5cm at the back.
Soft keys with not too much noise.
USB connection - quick to get set up.
CON:
Could provide more options for keyboard rake on adjustable stands (forward tilt).
Quite chunky (not slimline)
An exceptionally good keyboard for the price.', '2018-12-20T17:32:52+00:00', '2', 'false', '1638', '1129') ;

I"m an office administrator and at work I need a keyboard so I can comfortably type while still being more than arm"s length from my laptop. This was a perfect answer! Long cable, quiet keys that don"t click suitable for office work, soft press keys that are very easy on the fingers/wristsand not so small they are difficult to press or so big they are awkwardly spaced etc. It has kept very well over the last five months, being heavily used nine hours a day five days a week, none of the letters have rubbed off and all keys are still accounted for. I bought a previous cheap keyboard from eBay but it had keys in places other than where they were labelled, some just didn"t work, they were loose, loud and took several pressed sometimes to make work right from brand new. This is completely the other end of the spectrum, everything works, smartly packaged instead of just tape and bubble wrap, high quality and all keys are properly and accurately mapped out. Very good quality considering it is at the very low end of the budget for keyboards.
Postage was very prompt and for the money it was a great price. May not be suitable for gaming if you want programmable keys as there are none, it"s very easy to use at work and take wherever you like as it"s USB connection. Black and white design makes it look very smart on my desk and it"s been so hard wearing that if it broke tomorrow I"d just buy another one. It may not be what you want for a home computer if you"re looking for flashing lights, custom keys and clacking mechanical keys but it"s been a great addition to my desk.

You basically get what you would expect; a plug and play USB connected keyboard with the very basic of keys that should last you a number of years. There are a few special keys in the form of a play, pause and volume button, which is a bonus, but apart from that, there is no unnecessary bells and whistles. The keys feel responsive, cushioned and comfortable, which creates less noise when typing than keyboards I"ve used in the past. All in all a great and essential buy.

The build quality is significantly better than my old  Logitech (MK270 at £24.99) in a few ways: first, everything is built solidly meaning the keys don"t rattle at all. On my Logitech if I shook the keyboard, you"d hear the keys jiggle around. This Microsoft 600 Keyboard doesn"t do that. Second, the overall design seems to have not much cost cutting, the bottom of the device is solid plastic unlike the Logitech which had flimsy plastic and tons of cutout holes. And finally, the Microsoft keyboard has large rubber feet molded into the bottom of the keyboard (not just glued-on rubber pads that eventually come off).
The only flaw in the keyboard so far is the raisers don"t have rubber grips, so while the keyboard grips decently to the desk, the raisers are a bit slidey.
This is not a mechanical keyboard, it is just a membrane one - so don"t expect the best typing experience ever known, but if you are used to membrane keyboards like I am, then this is just more of the same. Function keys are small, so that may take some getting used to. The media controls are a nice addition too. And the keyboard also has SCRL/CAPS/NUM lock LED indicators. The top right of the keyboard has a nice shiny Microsoft logo (I think painted/printed on - maybe it will wear down over time).
I got the "White" variant, and while the pictures show a more greyish tone; they are deceiving. The keyboard really is white. While I was hoping for it to be greyish, I"m actually happy with the white. Its really nice and clean looking and blends nicely into my white desk. The wire and USB plug are also white. The keyboard is just plug in and go. Windows instantly recognizes it and it"s working within a couple of seconds.

First off I just want to say that I"ve been using mechanical keyboards a couple of years back - I own a Cherry MX Brown switch keyboard and used to have a Cherry MX Red one. I really like my mechanical keyboards, but sometimes I feel like the force you need to press down the keys and the noise made does take away from the experience.
I have been trying out rubber dome switches in recent times - I have tried dozens of them. My preference is towards low profile keys that require very little force to press down, making really fast typing and gaming possible, but it also needs to give a satisfying force on each press down and be comfortable to use for extended periods of times.
I first encountered this keyboard when I was working full-time as an office assistant, and I had one of these keyboards to use at my desk. I quickly fell in love with this keyboard and how easy it was to type on, as well as the extreme quietness of it.
I went and got one for myself for use as a gaming keyboard and I really like almost everything about this keyboard. The keypresses are very quiet if you type with normal force, even if you type furiously it is still much quieter than mechanical keyboards.
I can type really quickly on this keyboard, the keys go down very solidly and you know that you won"t miss a key because the actuation point is exactly when the key starts to move down.
Ergonomically, I really like the slight curve of the keys, it is subtle but you can really notice a difference to how you rest your hand on it. Makes long gaming/working sessions comfortable.
My only slight gripe with it is the function keys. The smaller size of the F-keys along the top makes sure you won"t press them by accident, and they are pretty satisfying to press, however there are a couple of games that use these keys (namely starcraft 2) and it does make it ever so slightly harder to press them. However it is still manageable as they are positioned well, you just need to get used to them having a different feel.
Best thing of all is that this is one of the cheapest keyboards you can get - so even if the buttons wear down slightly after months of use, you can buy 10 or more of these for the price of a mechanical keyboard, so that"s almost not an issue.', '2019-03-17T17:32:52+00:00', '2', 'false', '1638', '854') ;

I could still use my ps/2 keyboard if I wanted to keep it connected, but once I had disconnected the old keyboard it required a reboot to allow it to be used in the future, just a Windows driver thing, not an problem.

Right OK so we got that? OK...the thing about these cans is that they cost a paltry £40.
What these headphones show is that OneOdio has access to many (if not all) of the internal components that all of the various vendors use, package and tune in various different ways, with varying degrees of build quality and finish.
The drivers in these headphones are really quite good. The sound is pretty balanced, full and clean. Treble is not splashy, bass is not overblown and the midrange is not dulled down to create the illusion of "premium sound quality". Do they sound as good as the VModas or Shure"s mentioned just now, well, no of course they don"t, but then you are paying less than half to one fifth of what those can cost. Do they sound only half or only one fifth as good...no they do much better than this...but then we are into the law of diminishing return territory. That being said they still perform (audibly at least) ahead of their price tag.
Although these are closed back they are not the best at shutting out exterior noise. If that is an absolute priority for you then you may want to look elsewhere. The sound signature is that of a closed back headphone but not to the detriment of a sense of space around the track - so again an indication that the drivers are tuned pretty well against the packaging.
The packaging of the drivers is perhaps slightly less impressive. I know where I would rather have the money spent by OneOdio though. The enclosures are pretty solid if a little plasticky (so what). The ear pads are soft enough and thick and the headband is pretty well put together and sturdy. The adjustment is a little scratchy and after long periods of wearing you do know you have them on as they fit quite snuggly and are ever so slightly on the heavy side.
The removable cable to either a STANDARD 3.5mm or 6.5mm jack (one on each can) is just superb. None of your proprietary plugs or recessed jacks here. So you can use your own cable and mic or instal a VModa microphone (why I bought them) or daisy-chain two pairs of these together - so well done for the flexibility.
Play some good quality audio through these and they will do better then their price tag. Plug them into a headphone amp and play some uncompressed or Hi-Res audio and you will be patting yourself on the back that you spent just £40 on them. Detail resolution, timing, balance, bass detail and depth are all on point.
Oh and yes they do sound better than absolutely any Bluetooth headphones or buds I have heard so far - which for my money are still not up to even modest performance levels of wired cans with a semi respectable source fed to them.', '2018-12-01T17:32:52+00:00', '0', 'false', '1659', '93') ;

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('7348', 'If you dont want to read my rather long review, my summary is that these are nearly perfect if not for their insane sound leakage.
- great quality sound (9/10)
- loud volume (10/10)
- comfortable on the top of you head (7-8/10)
- comfortable on ears (8-9/10)
- noise cancelling (8/10) - they arent actually "active" noise cancelling, but are passive noice cancelling. of course you will always hear whats going on outside as with any $300 pair, but they block out background noise in general
- asthetics (7/10) - imo they dont look too trendy, but for the price thats no concern, and who gives a duck *quack* about appealling to the wider masses anyways eh?
noise leakage (0/10)
noise isolation (which is about cancelling external noises as much as possible and and reducing internal noise leakage as much as possible) - (4/10 - good enough cancellation, ridiculous leakage)
so what"s the problem? why am i returning them? because they dont have good noise isolation properties. "noise isolation" is supposed to be: 1- about blocking out, or cancelling (whether actively or passively (these are passive)), outside noise as much as possible; and, 2- about reducing sound LEAKAGE. these headphones fail on this second point. I kid you not when plugged into my iphone 6 at max volume, they"re literally like speakers (weak speakers but still so loud). For me, that"s a problem as i have flatmates to consider and as I dont want to be that guy who plays his music so loudly late at night nor in public.
If such excessive sound leakage is not a problem for you, i highly recommend these headphones as their sound their quality, their comfort, and (clearly) their volume are all top level. dont even bother with $300 Bose or Sony or Beats, try out these bad boys they will blow your mind!
However, if, like me, you want good quality loud headphones that isolate sounds (i.e. CANCEL external sounds and DON"T LEAK internal sounds) then look elsewhere. its as simply as that. Its weird to be sitting on a bus / in the tube with headphones loudly bursting out classical music which im trying to memorise for piano - imagine sitting in public while listening to chopin"s 1st ballade in g minor (DUUUUUUUNNNNNN, DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN, DUN DUN DUN DUN, DUN DUN DUN DUN DUUUUNNNNNNNUUUUNNNNNNNNHHHH - if you know, you know. if you dont know, google it), too loud and you look weird.
Also, dont bite my head off, i know these are "DJing" headphones and that leakage is not much of an issue for DJs as all they care about is having loud headphones that cancel outside sounds so they can hear their own music (i dont know mjuch about DJing). but "isolation" means 1- cancelling external sounds as much as possible and 2- reducing internal sound leakage as much as possible, so my argument is justified.', '2019-02-10T17:32:52+00:00', '1', 'false', '1659', '725') ;

The more expensive models have larger HDD (some with SSD) and more RAM (8 GB), but the processor is a i5-3470 (3.10 Ghz). So I figured it would be less hassle to get the one with the faster processor and just upgrade the RAM (which I did with a 240pin DDR3 8Gb single stick from crucial) and HDD later. EDIT: Also comes with a USB WiFi Adaptor. Very handy.
I will eventually get an NVIDIA GTX 1050ti Low profile as it can fit this slim profile.
Another thing I"m rather pleased about is that it comes preloaded with Windows 10 and Office 365*, as well as ESET internet security.
*you need to have a licence key or a 365 account which I already have from work.
So effectively I have a decent spec machine, with all the software, that doesn"t look dorky, is smart and slim, for about £200. ☺️

Fixed within 5 minutes with a long thin screwdriver to operate the release mechanism.
SSD is bodged installation beneath the power supply in the 3.5inch tray space with sticky tape and extra screw in the side to wedge in the smaller tray - see photo. But it all works ok!
Fast start-up with SSD, but the downside is that takes 2 minutes to restart on the SSD. Maybe this is a mismatched driver or bios issue that the refurbishers didn"t resolve when installing the SSD. Quicker to shut down and restart.

I use my laptop for video calling, occasional internet search and more recently i needed office. For what i need, it just about handles. Its slow and when clicking between windows can lag. After intial set up there was 9gb space left. I bought an sd card and changed settings to move everything possible to that to free up some memory. A month later having only installed a printer, security and a video call app i keep getting alerts that theres only 3gb memory left.
My advice would be to google as soon as its set up and find out which of the hp crap you can delete safely because theres so much uneeded rubbish. And some that you cant delete.

Plus, to add insult to injury, despite being advertised as a 32GB laptop, it came with a few MB, not enough space to do ANYTHING.
I spoke to HP support, who told me all was well (it was not) and that it was only intended for internet usage
(which my current one struggles with.) I spoke to Amazon support, who rightly identified an issue with the display driver and sent me a replacement.

A beautiful audio + visual presentation of this "90s classic which was loved by critics and public alike, and topped the charts worldwide, ultimately notching up 18+ million sales.

Only needed an extra laptop when i work remotely (so not the main use) . worked ok for 2 months then stopped charging this morning. Spoke to Amazon and they said there is a hardware issue with this model so will get the money back. ok with this but this doesn"t replace the laptop and i now need to search for a new one. So not extremely happy and will look for something better now.
Probably best to invest in something with a higher qualify and storage. all depends what you need it for', '2018-08-30T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '1816', '1019') ;
INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('10655', 'i normally only write reviews when i"m pissed, but this product deserves some praise, especially at the discount price i"ve got it for. the many bad reviews are all to do with running windows on a machine with 32gb storage and limited processing power! whoever came up with that idea must be insane! instead, i haven"t even touched the installed windows, but have replaced it with Lubuntu 18.04 on the very first run. wiped the laptop completely and ended up with an awesome machine that is a joy to use! remember, it must be 18.04 if you want everything to work out of the box!
pros:
thin, lightweight, large bright screen, small bezzel, really nice design, decent keyboard, track pad feels awkward but gets better with use...
cons:
quality not as good as with previous streams! sd card doesn"t click and lock, so no longer ideal for memory expansion! there is no power light on the power button. all the external connectors seem rushed and are difficult to use. speakers  often produce horrible high pitched noise, probably due to being made too small to handle the power.
in conclusion:
for the price, i can"t complain! once Lubuntu is installed, it really does everything I want it to do, and does it good! the only thing it could handle better are hd videos running at 60fps. up to 720p@60fps or up to 1080p@30fps everything is fine, above that it struggles as i think Lubuntu doesn"t make use of on-board gpu. although given the screen resolution there is no need to go above 720! for the smoothest youtube experience i recommend using sm player and sm youtube extension. there, even the contrast, saturation etc. can be adjusted... liberty office is way easier to use than office 365! you don"t need to register and it"s free! so is most other stuff for linux. Lubuntu is very customisable, looks better than windows. so there"s my advice. don"t be stuck with windows.', '2019-02-20T17:32:52+00:00', '2', 'false', '1816', '431') ;

Then, I decided to join the PCMR and get a keyboard with mechanical switches. Cue Cherry MX Blues, etc etc. I first had a Corsair K70, then a Razer BlackWidow Tournament Edition. But the thing was... ...wires. And I wanted to be able to switch between my Windows environment and my Raspberry Pi without a problem. And perhaps my Android phone too (yes, I really, really ditched Apple).
Now that I"ve "moderated" a little bit, I discovered the Logitech MX Anywhere 2S mouse. And then, days later, I was encouraged to buy this beauty. This is not a gaming keyboard by any stretch, but the keys are as good as the ones on my Lenovo ThinkPad T480S, and that"s saying an awful lot. They make a lovely noise which is dampened slightly by the hard rubber. The alphanumeric keys are concave, whilst the fn keys and modifier keys are convex.
The pressure feels just right. There is no plastiky feel. As I said, this really feels every bit as good as a ThinkPad keyboard. The keys feel responsive, but not to the point they feel unstable. The key travel is about as long as you would get on an Apple Wireless keyboard, but when the keys hit the end of their travel it just feels... ...nice. You want to keep typing. That"s why this review has gone on for so long.
Now to the rubber stand bit. I like it, it doesn"t get used much, but it sure is a nice visual feature. The rubber gives the keyboard a whacky weight to it. You could hit someone and jolly well hurt them with this thing. It"s rubber, but it"s not tacky. It feels incredibly good quality. This is like a ThinkPad keyboard mixed with a little modernity.

The keyboard also looks really nice.  I didn"t really buy it for the phone/tablet stand - but it does work well.  I got it purely cos it was the best looking keyboard Logitech make at the moment - I think - plus it had really good reviews.
It has taken a few days to adjust to some of the key placements; some keys are in slightly different positions than they were on my old keyboard, but that will probably be a similar problem when moving between most keyboards.

Typing on an angle gave me shoulder ache and using a cheap wireless keyboard in the centre was horrible and only ran one of the laptops.
Solution: This fantastic bit of kit, the K780. I was a bit wary of buying an "expensive" keyboard without trying it but it has a great feel and is as good as my benchmark keyboard on the Dell 1525. The keystrokes are short, positive and silent but the keyboard is so slim and solidly constructed (I think it might be solid aluminium) that the key impact noise transfers through to the desk instead. I would recommend something like a rubber mouse mat underneath to completely kill the noise.
I love this keyboard for its round keys which are very easy to hit correctly and for the ease of switching between laptops. I have one laptop on wireless using the dongle, the other on Bluetooth. I did set up the third channel for my mobile by Bluetooth but it doesn"t save much time as most mobile operations are pressing or swiping, it might be useful if you were blogging or doing something that involved a long tying session. I also bought a Logitech switchable mouse, again one laptop wireless via dongle, the other via Bluetooth. The downloaded software detected two receiver dongles and asked if I wanted to combine them onto one which it then did for me. Very easy and freed up a USB port.
Solid recommendation. One possible downside is the width of the "gutter" to support a phone or tablet, I think this is only about 11mm and my slim Huawei only just fits when it is in a case. Not a problem for me as I don"t use it but if this a reason for buying then beware.', '2018-12-21T17:32:52+00:00', '1', 'false', '1823', '895') ;

Typing Experience: The keyboard is quiet, comfortable and accurate. It has a reasonable amount of depth in key presses and the spacing between the keys is good. The rounded design of the keys seems to provide some added assurance for accurate typing (albeit it may be psychological).
Design: It looks good and has bit of weight due to the back panel which supports a tablet/phone. It doesn"t shift around on the desk and the black/white contrast is fine with a granite style design. No back lighting but not really a big deal as the model offering that feature is over x3 the price! Also has a num-pad which was needed.
Multi-Device: I can"t comment on the functionality as I have yet to use this with another PC or operating system but the setup on the Mac was straight forward to connect via Bluetooth.
Functions: Most Mac specific shortcuts are available although you may need to go through the online guide to find some more obscure options such as adjusting the brightness of the screen via the keyboard. Logitech options gives you a little bit more functionality. For example, there is no caps lock indicator on the keyboard or on screen but this can be made available via the software.

It is a really nice size for desktop use and good weight to support any devices you put into the slot. However I would therefore say it is not good to be carried around on a regular basis but more for moving between desktop work areas.
The Bluetooth pairing and subsequent device switching functionality is very well implemented, although bear in mind if you are setting up a workspace and switching between a PC and IPAD that a mouse will not work with an IPAD.

These are currently selling for £140- they were AKG"s flagship consumer reference model when launched and sold for hundred"s of pounds more at the time. At the current price they are remarkable value if you are looking for a detailed, largely neutral headphone.

The K240s have a far better balance left/right, front/rear & top/bottom and are THE ubiquitous studio headpone with good reason. They are accurate.
The K712s have the exact same sound balance as the K240s, even to the point of operating at exactly the same volume level on the headphone amp. They improve on the K240s with a larger soundscape, which gives each instrument more space and being larger & better built they are more comfortable for long periods. You can further improve their clarity, neutrality & impact by fitting leather Dekoni AKG Elite
Fenestrated ear pads, which are a significant upgrade in sound & comfort on the £20 velvet originals, and also by upgrading the cable - I use a  2.5m Naim Grey/Neutrik jacks lead.
The 712s are used on the end of a dedicated Naim headphone system and they  play all music, be it Beatles, Zappa, Ellington or Boulez, with  absolute aplomb & equanimity. The only downside is, being a true studio headphone, they will show up any faults in the recording or your hi fi chain. But if you want the unadulterated truth, warts and all, beauty and all, this is one of the most acurate headphones on the planet.

Awesome? I don"t feel that to be a strong enough word.

I"ll just explain (quickly) why.....
The first time I used these I thought they were nice headphones, pretty comfy and I suffer from a neurological disorder that makes me hypersensitive so I need really comfy headphones and these are pretty good at first but they are slowly getting better as the 3d foam seems to be getting more pliable and the fitting system is excellent as it doesn"t squash your head and just sits on top of your head nicely.
They cover my ears really well and the cable doesn"t get in the way and is soft and not heavy.
But the sound.......it"s almost like I was partially deaf before but now I can hear everything!!!!!!
Just to explain, I was listening to an orchestral soundtrack and everything was incredibly clear, like I was actually sitting I the middle of the musicians and the sound was all around me.
But I could hear a strange scratchy kind of sound every now and again and couldn"t work it out - was it a cable problem or was it the source itself?
No - it was the sound of the musicians turning the pages of their sheet music!!!!
I put my Sony closed back headphones on as a comparison and it was so different, they just sounded like headphones do but the AKG K702"s sound like you are there, in the room with the musicians and they pick up every sound in the room.

The most notable improvement I"ve had has been with the bass elements of my mixes, which I"m guessing is because they don"t colour the sound as much as what I"ve previously used.
They are reasonably well made, but I wasn"t blown away by the build quality to be honest, after a few months of daily use they seem like they should last if your"e not transporting them around all the time. They are comfortable after you get used to them (I also wear glasses), but I don"t notice I"m wearing them even after 2-3 hours.
I don"t have the cash for high end studio gear, but to be honest I would have no desire to upgrade these right now anyway, I think that they do a great job.', '2019-02-16T17:32:52+00:00', '0', 'false', '1843', '734') ;

These have a very neutral sound with amazing levels of detail and clarity along with a very wide open sound that brings out massive amounts of detail to the point where you can hear every instrument down to the sound of the guitar string being plucked and piano key being struck.
These are very much indoor headphones and need a fair bit of power to get the best from them; don"t expect to get the best from them using your mobile phone.
Lots of people complain about the lack of bass; it"s true they are not bass heavy headphones but I think that the levels of bass are exactly where they are supposed to be.', '2018-08-30T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '1843', '1069') ;

Im not one for all these fancy headphones with lights and wireless rubbish that you really don"t need. These headphones just give me what I"m looking for: Quality, comfort, versatility, lightweight and more.
The detachable wire on the headset allows for safe transportation, so nothing it damaged when putting it in your bag or case. The two plastic tube at the top are very flexible, allowing for varying head sizes. As well at that, the headband has 2 elastic strands each side, pulling the headband back down to its original position.
The actual sound quality is great, I"ve listened to my favourite band for over 10 years and even now when I listen to some of their songs, I"m amazed that I can still hear new sounds in familiar songs. I would recommend getting a DAC with these headphones, as personally for me, the base volume isn"t as loud as i liked it to be - this is of course down to you and your specifications.
I have had serious medical issues with the left side of my head, just around my ear in the past, so its unfair to judge against these headphones that after prolong use, I do suffer some minor pain here and there.
I would say that the cable could be slightly longer, however, as I said before, it all depends on your setup and specifications. All around great headset, and would recommend it to anyone.', '2018-12-16T17:32:52+00:00', '0', 'false', '1843', '934') ;

Setup was easier than expected, although if you’ve never used Windows 10 before, be aware that you need a Microsoft Account to register it with. This can be a hotmail/live/outlook email address, but you may need to strengthen your password before it will let you use that to login to your PC.
After setting it up, Windows 10 then tries to download system patches and security updates and this is where you may run into trouble if, like me, you went for the 32GB storage. Without any extra software installed and prior to any updates being downloaded, I had 18.6GB free out of the 32GB storage. Windows Update then downloaded 2 huge updates (1709 and 1803), plus a few other smaller updates. The built-in storage went down to as low as 5.4GB free and the PC almost ground to a halt. I held my breath and it eventually restarted and applied these updates. After a couple more restarts, I was still left with only around 6GB to play with which was a disappointment. After Googling, I found that you can reclaim disk space used by previously downloaded updates so I did that and the final useable space went up to 11.5GB. Not great, but as long as you’re not planning to install lots of software or media files it’s just about workable. I would advise you go for 64GB storage as a minimum and you should be left with around 40GB to 45GB to play with - plus you can add more with the SD card slot (note: this can’t be used for system storage though, so try to keep on top on Windows Updates so you’re only downloading one at a time)
Whilst this PC is no speed demon, partly due to having only 2GB RAM, it’s perfectly usable if your demands aren’t too high. It will stream YouTube in HD smoothly and without buffering. One thing I struggled with is the Sky Go Player, which didn’t stream well at al with buffering and out of sync audiol, but that could be down to Sky themselves so I’m not being overly critical of that. Sadly, this was one reason why I bought this, so slightly miffed not to be able to use it for that purpose.
A few other niggles: it flatly refuses to see my faster 5GHz wireless network and will only connect to the slower 2.4GHz network, so I’ve connected with an Ethernet cable instead - luckily, it’s near my router so no big issue. Also, it only has one x USB 1.1 and one USB 2.0 port - so no USB 3.0 if you were hoping to connect a faster hard drive. Hard to be critical at this price point though, I paid just £86 for a full PC so it’s still good value for money.
All in all, this is a great option if you accept that it has some limitations and I wouldn’t recommend it if you want to play games, but for light use and office applications as well as web browsing and email, it’s perfect - and such a tiny size too!
I’m wishing I paid a little more to get 64GB storage and 4GB RAM, but I can’t blame the PC’s manufacturers for the size of Microsoft’s update files. I still think this is a cracking PC for the price.', '2018-09-25T17:32:52+01:00', '2', 'false', '1921', '591') ;

Thanks to Prime, the shipping went fast and the Mini PC was well packed.
The first impression is good. Everything is well made and the PC is really handy and looks stylish.
After supplying power, I connected it to my AV receiver and started. As an input device I connected via USB an infrared Air Mouse (normal keyboard with mouse is of course synonymous). This was also recognized directly at startup.
When booting starts directly the well-known setup program Win10 and I have made all the necessary settings. Sound and picture was given directly perfect.
The first time Windows starts, you can start installing the latest updates directly. But you have to be patient. The whole update process took about 3 hours, but it was worth the wait. The whole system runs fast and stable. I honestly did not expect that.
After the whole update process, however, only 5 GB of free memory are available. For this reason, I have expanded the memory by a Micro SD card by 32GB.
Since the default language is English, I downloaded and installed the German language pack after installing it in the Windows settings. After a restart, everything is in German.
Applications are opened relatively quickly. Internet Explorer builds up quickly and even video files are played smoothly within a few seconds.
The main reason for me was the game Hearthstone. This is reproduced after installation without any problems and can now be played on the screen with me (beamer).
I also installed Kodi as a media center. Again, everything runs smoothly.

If you want a cheap laptop for browsing, email, basic word processing etc then this might be for you.

I use an android phone and if you do too, then you"ll get on with this.
Downside is that it"s a bit limited when without WiFi, and storage ain"t great, and if you have an i device then you won"t be able to use it with this (as far as I know).
The brilliant thing was the process for getting it set up is as follows:
- Plug it in.
- Turn it on.
- Log in with your Gmail account
That"s it. All your bookmarks, email drive and everything Googly is ready to use and it takes less than a minute.
I believe (though not tried it) that you are still able to use Microsoft Office (if you have to) as long as you"re happy using it in the browser.
There are more and more apps on the Play Store for this, including Spotify and Netflix.

I"ve been listening to the Sig Pro non-stop since they arrived, and for my head they are as comfortable as any I"ve worn. My main home headphones are LCD-2 and I love their sound which seems to work very well for my preferred listening, I didn"t expect the new ones to match the LCDs, and they don"t, quite. But they are remarkably close. They have quite an open feel for a closed headphone and the Copland and Gershwin feel very spacious. I"m not a major bass head, but I dug out some meatloaf and felt really nice, absolutely bassy enough for me but still strong on the voice. Brass sounds really good, bold and bright - just the way I like it.
Next step, going portable. This was the main reason for buying them so I really needed them to behave nicely with my IBasso DX-100. And they really do. To my ears, they actually work better with the DX-100 than the LCD-2s.

Other hifi equipment owned: Cambridge Audio DacMagic Plus
Why I bought these: I wanted top quality sound with great isolation to stop external sounds leaking in and stopping me enjoying my music.
Good points for the Ultrasone Signature Pro:
To start with a caveat, these are probably not a bass-seeker"s dream phones. Having said that, in music which calls for it (e.g. Massive Attack"s "Mezzanine"), there is ample bass. But rather than it being bloated and resonant like with cheap phones, the Sig Pro"s bass is crisp, quick and punchy. It has quantity AND quality, but with the emphasis very definitely on the quality side.
There is lots of detail available in bass, mid and high frequencies. You can easily separate out all the musical instruments in a recording. I noticed things that only the Ultrasone Edition 8 (at well over a thousand quid) brought out. For all the detail, your music is presented, erm... musically, as opposed to overly analytically. This means, in my experience, that you can listen to these phones for many hours without the fatigue that usually comes with highly analytical headphones.
The isolation is fantastic: at only moderate volume, you hear nothing when snapping your fingers beside your ears. In terms of sound leaking out, provided you sit 1.5+ meters from your colleagues you should be able to enjoy your music without inflicting much noise on them. However, if you want to listen more loudly, probably the only way to go is in-ear monitors as there"ll definitely be some leakage as you push the volume.
The soundstaging is superb for a closed headphone. They sound nearly as open as the Grado SR60i; it"s like the music is coming from 5-8 inches outside your ears.
The build quality is solid and feels like the headphones will last for a good few years (and of course there"s the 2-year warranty if purchased from an authorized Ultrasone dealer to cover you if anything does go wrong). They"re made of the same plastic as the Ultrasone Pro 900s. Basically it"s a high-grade plastic that feels sturdy and, unlike lots of other plastic stuff, it doesn"t feel cheap. I believe the drivers are the same ones used in the Edition 8s.
Finally, they"re very easy to drive. I have a Sony MP3 player and I can have it at 80% of max volume and that"s plenty loud.
Bad points for the Ultrasone Signature Pro:
As you"d expect, for something with such good isolation, they clamp your ears a lot! I modded them a little to ease the pressure on my ears, which would otherwise become tiresome. But that is very easily accomplished so it"s a gripe rather than a real issue of any kind.
Other points: They need broken in for a minimum of 50h+ hours. The package includes 2 replaceable cables and a semi-rigid carry case, both of which add value for me personally.
As good as they sound when driven off a good MP3 player (my rating is 85/100, as compared with the Grado SR60i and Ultimate Ears 10"s 60/100 or the Ultrasone Pro 900"s 75/100), they sound so much better (around 95/100) if you add a digital-analogue converter (DAC). Why? There"s a big jump in dynamic range and the separation of instruments, and therefore your music sounds crisper and richer. A headphone this good deserves a top feed and a good DAC gives it exactly that.

My music taste literally covers all genres of music, however the main two i listen to is Techno and Soul music. These two genres of music couldn"t really be further apart which is why i spent so many hours trying to find a pair of headphones which can adapt to music styles not just focused purely on one.
I absolutely love the sound that the Signature Pros produce. It is so pure and refined and with the S Logic Plus technology you get such a pleasant, weightless sound from them when listening to genres of music that have a lot of vocal and instruments involved. I have paired these with the Cambridge Audio DACMAGIC XS as i personally think it is the best portable headphone amp for below £100. Combining these two devices together enabled me to unlock even more sound from the Signature Pros and i would definitely recommend getting this amp/or something very similar.
These headphones really will open your mind when it comes to listening to your music library, you hear songs you love on a completely new level which is such a satisfying feeling. When it comes to the electronic side of my music library, the Signature Pros bass/treble/mids/highs are all absolutely spot on. The best way to describe the sound from these headphones is balanced. You won"t get the thumping, over powering bass punch you get from the Pro 900"s, which i had at first and liked for around 2 hours of music listening. The biggest high for me about these headphones is they do not fatigued your ears even after hours and hours of music listening.
The build quality is second to none, very robust and solid design with swivel cups for portability. I could genuinely talk about these headphones all day as they have become a part of my life! They produce a sound you actually look forward to hearing, you will find yourself re listening to your entire music library when they arrive just to hear it sound so pure.

The build quality, whilst very lightweight, feels rather cheap. They also do not have a removable cable, which is a big downside. And even worse, the cable is permanently trying to coil itself back up to the way it was packaged. And the cable doesn"t feel that strongly attached to the headphones - and i fear with an accidental yank, you could easily tear out the cable, rendering the headphones useless.
In regards to sound quality, i put my ~7 year old Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro 250 ohm headphones to rest, after a good amount of service life out of them. And comparing the audio quality of those, to these Audio Technicas? They are a big drop in audio quality. It doesn"t sound so clear, or crisp compared to my DT 990"s. However the audio is still slightly better than those budget £30 - £35 headphones companies try to sell off as "premium gaming headphones".
The main selling point of these, is the soundstage. Due to the design, directional audio is VERY good, and far better than any 7.1 headsets i"ve tried. It helps a lot with gaming, particularly FPS games. Also very nice for ASMR videos, providing you are in a quiet environment - as the open design does allow a lot of sound to both escape, and enter.

1. The 3D wing support is rubbish.  It"s not strong enough to support the headphones on your head properly, if you shake your head or body the headphones will slip down off your ears.  There are workarounds such as attaching some elastic between the wings which will stop them spreading to far but when you are paying £113 for something you don"t expect to need to implement workarounds to get it functioning correctly.
2. The bigger problem though is the fixed cable.  As others have commented on, the cable quality is not great and you can"t change it out.  No matter how much I try, I cannot get the cable straightened out, it has a habit of trying to curl itself back up which is irritating enough on its own but it"s also quite long and there"s no way of shortening it without having a coiled up cable lying around.

I originally had a pair of BeyerDynamic DT770 250 Ohm cans that lasted about 7 years before the daughter got her hands on them and then I had them returned with the bass gone.  Stored away to await resurrection in the future, but I loved them and was trying to get a pair of cans that would come close to them - times have moved on? I have had a home studio of varying sizes according to the necessities of living - I had one a couple of years back with insulated walls, foam all over the walls and ceiling and a floating floor, doing mainly guitar oriented projects but using a M-Audio Axiom Air now as a MIDI controller/keyboard and using an old Mac Pro with 2x4 cores on board, 26GB and Yosemite running Logic X and a Roland Tri-Capture interface as well as a Windows 7 machine with an i3, 16GB of fast DDR3 and SSD running Cubase Elements with a Presonus Inspire 1394  running Firewire through a TI chip equipped PCI card.  Got a pair of Audio-Technica ATH-PRO700MK2 phones from fleabay for a song and thought those would do the trick - they don"t.  They were HORRIBLE.  I don"t know how a) Audio-Technica can put their name to such a piece of junk, and b) how they get away with charging so much for them.  The bass was so overwhelming that it distorted everything from 400Hz up.  Lots of bass yes, but at the expense not only of top end but mid range as well?....they
went back on fleabay, sold for more than what I"d paid for them. I think that says it all.  Then got a pair of AKG K77s from Amazon to tide me over till Xmas and also to act as my new closed phones. The AD500Xs are of course, open.  These K77s are OK, I haven"t "burned them in" using white and pink noise, but as reviewers on other sites have pointed out, you really shouldn"t have to burn ANY cans in, because the manufacturer would hardly sell a piece of kit needing that sort of treatment - and I understand.  Yes, I can accept large paper diaphragms on big floor standing speakers may need breaking in, but polypropylene 15mm drivers?  I don"t think so.  These K77s are very midrange light to my ears and not very revealing at all - very muddy and also not very efficisteven wilson
ent - they are pretty quiet. So. Xmas comes round and I"m writing this on New Years Day.  Not a lot of time to judge, so these are my first impressions If you"re not used to open cans as I was, be prepared to be shocked.  These are very revealing.  You can literally hear everything and
 the soundstage is wonderful.  The bass is not too untidy either - I ran Nick Beggs" excellent work on "Luminol" by Steven Wilson on "The Raven That Refused To Sing" and also The Cure"s "The Walk - Everything Mix" on "Mixed Up" through because I knew they were going to sound good.  And they do.  I couldn"t track with these - that"s not what they"re made for.  But listening to commercial music and mixing?  Perfect.  Deducted one point because I don"t have the smallest head around (Bloke, 57cm measurement, motorcycle helmet size Medium) and as they come at the smallest adjustment I can"t pull them down anymore, which I would like to do, as they are comfortable (but not as comfortable as the velour pads on DT770s) but don"t feel totally secure.

GOOD
Amazing sound field and sound quality
Very competitively priced for such a good listening experience
Light and comfortable to wear
BAD
Stupidly long cable
No factory seal on the box
Not good for listening to low quality recordings
Inside use only, not really designed to use when walking around the streets
I purchased these mostly to listen to music at home and am very happy with them for this purpose. The ATH-500x have proved to be better than my expectations, for this price range. They have been used on a computer, a smart phone, an AV amplifier and a Television.
Music - I have mostly been using these to listen to Classical music but have also tried them with a selection of Pop and Rock music dating from the 1970"s through to the present day. The sound and sound field on these cans blew me away and they were found to be excellent for all the genres of music, that I tend to listen to, from a well recorded source. The only criticism that I have is that they are so good at reproducing sound that they will pick up every fault in a bad recording or reproduction. I have no Idea of how these sound with Rap or DJ type stuff as I do not listen to this type of music very often.
Spoken word - Again a well produced video clip or pod-cast is a delight to the ears through the Audio Technicas but listening to a bad source feels like you have put your ears in a paper shredder. This I found out when I hooked these phones up to a mono, Long Wave, radio, to listen to a cricket commentary.
Films and TV - I have a pair of headphones specifically designed for this and I have to admit that the AD 500x were not as good as those for watching films and TV series. So if this is the main reason that you want a pair of headphones, you would be well advised to look elsewhere. But having said that and your main purpose for buying these is for music and they are only occasional to be hooked up to the TV or AV system, these still give a nice reproduction for sound accompaniment to visual media.
Comfort and Fit - These are big "phones but surprisingly light in weight. They have proved comfortable and relatively secure to wear. It is no problem walking around the house and getting on with stuff, whilst listening to these. They would be no good for going jogging though and really are confined to indoor use. There is very little heat build up in the cans (It is July at the time of writing this) due, I presume, to the open backed design. The pads feel good against my head and are secure but do not clamp too hard. Two to three hours continual use has been no problem.
THE DOWNSIDES
Sound Leak - These "phones bleed sound like crazy but they are open backed, so this is only to be expected.
The Cable - The three meter cable has not proved to be so bad as some drama queen reviewers on YouTube have been whining about. I coiled most of it up and tied it with freezer bag ties and this has solved that problem. But with good quality cable extensions being cheep and easily available, it is hard to understand why there is not a nice meter and a bit cable on these cans.
No Factory Seal - This, I have found, is not a problem specific to this product. It seems that all Audio Technica headphones have no factory seal on their boxes. Headphones are a very personal product and in these times when many people return stuff that they have sourced from the internet it is important to know that such a body intimate product is fresh from the factory and has not been, possibly, pre used by someone with poor cleanliness habits. Audio Technica, you really need to sort your lives out on this point.
CONCLUSION
There are better headphones on the market but most of these cost four or more times the asking price of the Audio Technica ATH-500x headphones. As I am the kind of person who likes to squander their money on fripperies such as paying the mortgage,  putting food on the table, paying fuel bills and other such things that means that there is only so much left in the budget for headphones. These headphones give a real Audiophile experience at a price achievable by many people. They are, to date, the best sounding music headphones that I have ever owned and the ownership experience has so far proved to be a very positive one. They do have a few downsides, nothing is perfect, so out of 100 I would give these a 95 percent and so the five star rating. To sum up, they are great quality headphones at a very competitive price.', '2018-12-30T17:32:52+00:00', '1', 'false', '203', '662') ;

Keyboard is USB rechargeable, a few hour charge can last months (depending on usage). No need to change batteries ever again. This is a big plus for me as i travel a lot, don’t really want to have to remember batteries when you’re travelling.

The gatefold presentation is brilliant with track lists and info from composers / bands present with a nice picture of the chairman with the band behind him.
The tracks go from Frank"s early recordings (side A is mono I think) to his later recordings in a fairly chronological order.
As far as the quality goes, it"s a pretty good pressing. I heard barely any pops or cracks. Due to side A having older tracks there was a bit of background "hiss" present, but this did not distract or get in the way. Side B to D had wonderful separation, Frank"s singing prominent above the mix, the various brass sections rising and falling around a solid well produced percussion / rhythm section. Overall an enjoyable listen.

Runs Android / Chrome apps also well. Have not tested with games, as this is not my thing, but remember ,  Android apps are geared towards mobile power so this Chrome book should do just fine.  3.Keyboard, is Ok, a bit small (but the computer is small) but seems of good quality, 4.Speakers are Ok, but they are downward facing (which makes no sense to me); 5.completely versatile, flip into V for Netflix watching or presentations or turn into a tablet mode; 6.Battery is good as you would expect. 7.Build: sold (as you would expect, as this is expected to sell into the education market).

If you use Chrome as your regular browser on your home PC, the Chromebook comes up instantly  (after you enter your email account) and you are up  -- nothing more to do.  Stays in sync with you home PC too.  You should be using something like POCKET to keep your bookmarks synced.
Fast,  you"re in Chrome after 2 seconds of entering your email password.  This is a great auxiliary machine for the price and functionality; far better than carrying an big mobile.

Or use your cell phone in Tethering mode as a WiFi server.  The HMDI port allows you view your movies (or streamed videos, Netflix, etc) on a large screen - when I travel, I can continue watching a Netflix series or share a movie with friends at the hotel room.

Both the keyboard and mouse are what I would call "full size" so are well suited to all-day usage. Build quality is excellent with all key and button presses feeling nice and positive and a nice smooth scroll action on the mouse wheel.
Installation on Windows 10 is as straightforward as plugging in the USB receiver and popping the batteries (included) into the Keyboard and Mouse.
All of the standard keyboard keys will work without any additional software being installed. If you wish to use the additional customisable keys at the top of the keyboard, or reconfigure some of the other keyboard functions, it"s a simple case of downloading the Microsoft Keyboard and Mouse Center application from the Microsoft website and using the straightforward interface to tailor the keyboard to your needs.

Pros:
+ Comfortable and sturdy
+ Lots of extra buttons (volume +/-, calculator, e-mail, homepage, 5 user-defined favourites etc.)
+ Mouse works on almost any surface (leather couch armrest, jeans, wooden floor, glass tabletop)
Cons:
- No forward/back buttons on mouse
- No mute button beside volume controls
- Dongle is quite big; inconvenient for use with laptops
- All the (sometimes) useful extra buttons take room from "ESC" and "F" keys, meaning they seem unnecessarily small, which is annoying if using them often (e.g. Excel or certain games) They also don"t have the traditional gaps between F4 & F5 and F8 & F9
The cons may seem insignificant - and to some I"m sure they are - but since this is a newer model than the set I was replacing, I wasn"t really expecting them to take a couple of steps backwards by removing useful things. The mute button is no big deal but the lack of extra buttons on the mouse seems like a major oversight.

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('7967', 'I"ve wanted a decent wireless keyboard and mouse for months.  The last time I bought one, which was several years ago, the Logitech unit I ended up with was one of the worst keyboards I"ve ever used and I was anxious not to end up in the same situation.  I narrowed it down to this, the Microsoft Wireless Desktop 3000 (which seems to have more features but is the same price...weird) and an Anker wireless keyboard/mouse bundle.
It arrived bent out of shape, so one corner of the keyboard was higher than the other...a bit like when a table has a wonky leg.  A little brute force to bend the entire plastic casing a little and it was almost as good as new, so I could type without the entire keyboard tilting back and forth.  Not a great start, but all"s well that ends well.  Both keyboard and mouse come with branded batteries which is good, with the mouse using 2 x AAs and the keyboard using 2 x AAAs; the 2 AAs in the mouse makes it nicely weighted.
The mouse is decent, fairly comfortable and the plastic casing doesn"t feel too cheap.  The scroll wheel is smooth (i.e. you can"t feel tiny ridges as you turn the wheel, like you can with some other mice...personally, I prefer this) but "stiff" enough to be completely controllable.  The wheel can also be clicked down, left and right (all of which appear to be configurable).
The keyboard is also pretty decent.  It has a wrist rest which works but is made of hard, cheap feeling plastic (as is the entire keyboard).  The keys are non-mechanical so are soft and reasonably quiet (apart from the space bar, which makes much more noise than every other key).  You can configure all the function keys but you have to then use the Fn key to activate the custom function.  It would be nice to be able to set this on or off and I think you can do this with the 3000 version of this set.  There are also several soft-keys which you can assign functions without having to use another key combination; these are useful but very stiff to press...much, much more so than the other keys.  It could simply be because it"s new but only time will tell.
Now the not so good...
The mouse feels too small.  I"ve always used one of the old Microsoft Intellimouse units until now and I suppose the new wireless mouse will take a bit of getting used to; it"s shorter than my old corded Intellimouse which (at the moment, at least) feels awkward.
There"s no getting away from the fact the the keyboard feels cheap.  There"s an abundance of single use and customisable keys which to me are just gimmicks.  Do I really need a key whose sole purpose is to open the Windows calculator?  Probably not.  One of the worst things about this keyboard is the keys" decals are very reflective.  This means that if you have overhead lighting (such as halogen downlighters), it"s very difficult to see some of the decals, dependent on where the light falls, because they reflect the light back into your eyes.  During the day or with ambient light, it"s fine but something to bear in mind.

The keyboard feels cheep. Not too noisy, but doesn"t feel like it would take much hammer before breaking and now I"m getting quite annoyed as I keep mistyping.
The mouse is a big disappointment. It takes two AA batteries making it pretty heavy. Doesn"t bode well for long battery life if it needs two unlike Logitech which uses one and lasts over a year. The other annoyance is the wheel button which is smooth rolling and requires a heavy press, not much use if you play first person shooters as I do and use the wheel for weapon selection, you may just find the game flips to using a rocket launcher when your trying to shoot a bad guy at point blank with a shot gun.

I can easily pick this up and use it in multiple places around my computer.  The keyboard also has a nice set of extra buttons (to launch extra programs, control music/video playback, and adjust volume) that I frequently use.  Moreover, the keyboard is set up so that the extra butons are placed at the top; I do not need to worry about accidentially hitting something like I did when I used my previous keyboard (a Logitech wireless keyboard).

The received is OK; it works over a few meters, but it doesn"t work well if inserted into a rear port on a desktop computer.
While the keyboard has held up well over two years, the mouse is beginning to disintegrate.  The padding went about a year ago, and the pads shredded the surface underneath it until I peeled them off.  Now the rubberized surfaces are disintegrating.  This is a particular problem with the rubber belt on the outside of the scroll wheel, which is on the verge of coming off, which would make it difficult to use.  As it is, the scroll wheel has become more stiff recently.

It makes virtually no sound at all when you"re typing which is great for working (or gaming!) at night when everybody else is trying to sleep, and also the keys in the vertical-middle of the keyboard are slightly lower than the others which makes typing a lot more comfortable.

The mouse, on the other hand, isn"t quite as good. It"s a comfortable shape and the right sort of size for a fifteen-year-old"s hand and I have no complaints on it"s surface ability due to the "Bluetrack Technology", but the wheel of the mouse isn"t really to my liking. I"ve only ever had two mice in my lifetime so I don"t know if this is the new design of mouse or something but the wheel hasn"t got any grooves or notches so it"s a little less precise when scrolling. I had to install the microsoft software (which, by the way, was ridiculously easy to do) and managed to make the scrolling more precise but having no bumps in the wheel is definitely a problem for me.

+ software makes scrolling and movement easy to customize to your liking

I remember at the time being a bit underwhelmed by it, I think it was a combination of being very much in love with the whole rave feel of the "Experience" album and also them changing and coming into the Big Beat thing and I was fearing they were going the way of that current fad. However I need not have worried.
As we all know the best bands constantly evolve and change, you can"t stay the same really (except for a few). Majorly flavoured by Liam Howlett"s penchant for Front 242 at the time, you can feel the Belgian"s influence rippling through the beats and basslines throughout the album.
Apart the obvious "Poison", "One Love" and "Voodoo People", I feel there are better tracks on this album, such "Full Throttle" (which brings a little memory of the Rave scene back into focus), "Speedway (Theme from Fastlane)" which really sounds like what it says on the tin and gets you going. Then its the brooding, heavy broken beats of "The Heat (The Energy)". Following that up is the epic "Narcotic Suite" containing the trio of "3 Kilos" (a little techno Jethro Tull anyone to start us off slowly, also with an essence perhaps of the laid-back vibe of San Fran thrown in for good measure?). Then off we go to the chiming, bubbling bounce of "Skylined" before we are led into the pulsing, menacing breakbeat stomp of "Claustrophobic Sting".
How very Prodigy to start off a trio of songs all relaxing and then lead us into a crazy, dark space! Back when electronica had teeth.', '2018-05-08T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '2195', '893') ;

I will try to be as unbaised as possible here, and to give you a more definitive answer I will compare this model with a 2016 Macbook pro, a 6 year old hp envy m6 (which was roughly in the same price bracket when bought new) and a 2018 Ipad.
I am definitely not an average user, and the number one reason I needed two of these machines was to get ~48GB of ram (in total) and decent CPU performance without spending a fortune, or throwing out perfectly functioning old technology. For me, the cheapest option was to get two T430 and upgrade both with 16GB ram.
The way I use both all of these machines together is depicted below:
Machine 1: HP envy 1TB ssd, 16gb RAM(right monitor): main machine, used primarily for research and data storage.
Machine 2: Thinkpad T430, the first one (left monitor): with 1TB ssd and 16GB ram: Used for office work and going through video materials: Machine 1 & 2 typically have 4 programs open side by side.
Machine 3: Ipad 2018 with apple pencil: Used to make notes in onenote (which is synced across all machines), and do graphic designs (hence the apple pencil), which is also synced across all machines.
Machine 4: Thinkpad T430, the second one (closed on table); currently only used to offload video encoding tasks when Machine 1 and 2 are busy. May eventually consider connecting it to another monitor, if required.
All data is synced between machines using cloud storage. If any of these machines fail on the spot, I have the data mirrored between all three of them, which gives me piece of mind. I use software to share a mouse and keyboard between the two machines over the local network.
T430 impressions:
First of all, for ~300£ this may look like a bargain, and it is, only if you do not require a good screen or good battery life. Having bought 2 so far (and kept both) I feel like a can honestly give feedback on the performance of these models.
My use case is very specific: out of all the laptops that I have I use them all with an external monitor + keyboard and mouse the majority of the time.
The reasons I chose the t430 are:
1- cheap
2- I know for a fact ram/ ssd and cpu are indeed upgradable: this was an the only way for me to fit 1tb ssd into my budget.
3- This is one of the few laptops you can get in this price bracket that would support enterprise security features, such as TPM.
4- I have researched these models and can confirm that they do not overheat even under full load (at least, the two laptops I recieved do not). For someone who has another laptop from 2016 which regularly hits 100c at full load, and the HP which cannot run at full load without throttling, this is a big plus.
Cosmetic damage
The units do come refurbished, with cosmetic damage here and there: scratches and bumps, but nothing that would stop you from using them. If you care about the clean look, don"t get one of these.

The screens on these models are ATROCIOUS compared to what you can get in 2018: it doesnt matter if you pick up the 1600x900 or 1366x769 models: both have old TN panels that are just NOT good to look at. The reason why I dont care about that is:
1- I have been using high quality monitors for the last 6 years, and use the laptops with the monitors for the majority of the time.
How to make the screen better: you can theoretically upgrade to an IPS panel, but that is not a trivial fix nor is it cheap, running to about 150£. I solved this problem by getting myself an ASUS pa227ac monitor (which I would strongly recommend). The thinkpad runs that 2k Monitor with no problems, it is even able to play 2K Video with no stuttering. 4K video is out of the question though.
The performance
The performance of the machine is good, by which I mean it would not have any issues doing common office tasks, browsing, even light gaming potentially. For 300£, you cannot expect a stellar level of performance without some upgrades (see below):
1- The SSD model you get is a bit of a lottery it seems: One of my units came with a samsung SSD. The other one came with a "SOLID" ssd brand, which I have never heard of. Since I knew i will replace all SSD"s with brand new ones, I didn"t care that much. Both original SSD"s were about as fast as each other, booting in about 5 seconds and chewing through common tasks: for example, open office installed itself in under a minute. Both SSD"s definitely make the machines feel brand new (even though they are 6 years old!).
 To be on the safe side, I replaced both of those ssd"s with brand new mx500 crucial drives: there are SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER than the default drives. with "overprovisioning" and "momentum cache" turned on via crucials software, I can easily push 300-600mb/s write speeds: for comparison, it takes about 10 seconds to copy a 4gb compressed folder, and about 5 minutes to make the backup of the entire drive (around 30GB of data): pretty impressive.
To compare this to my HP envy which has 2 MX500 SSD"s in RAID 0 (write speeds of around 1.5GB/s, comparable to brand new macbooks) and a 2016 macbook pro:
Everyday tasks: there is really no difference between all three laptops. Unless you are working with massive files, copying around 1gb worth of data is near instantaneous on them all: T430 =~=HP=~=2016MBP.
BIG files (photos, videos etc), over 20GB: the HP and the MBP are definitely faster. Will you notice the speed difference in a blind test though? probably not.
Multitasking: the T430 only has 8gb of ram, which does make it quite limited if you need to multitask. This should be ok for most people, as you cannot easily get 8gb of ram for a new 300£ laptop even in 2018. The bump to 16GB makes a huge difference: this bump will cost you around 130£, if you choose to do so. Note that 16GB of ram is the maximum this machine supports.
Upgrade and actual cost of ownership
I upgraded my thinkpads with a new (bigger) ssd and 16gb of RAM, making my unit cost me closer to 500£ each, and not the 300 odd that is advertised. If I ever decide to upgrade the CPU as well (around 100£ and half a day of work), the performance overall would be on par with brand new  £1200-1500£ machines in 2018 at the expensive of having a good screen and battery life.
The price for these does vary, it is definitely a bargain for 300 odd, possibly even 380 if you can find one with 16GB ram.
If you buy this with the intension of using this with an external monitor, I would say go for it. If not, it would really depend whether you can tolerate the screen quality. Make no mistake, there is a night and day difffernce between the new IPS screens and old TN panels.
for 200£ you can upgade this machine to easily match the new machines of 2018 that cost much more than 500-600£.
for 300£ you can get this machine upgraded to 16GB RAM and 1TB SSD, something that you will struggle to find in a budget model in 2018
Overheating / Heat dissipation performance
 The CPU in this machine does not go over 80c at full load, and even then, the fan noise is not annoying. Having said that, the fans do spin pretty much all the time. It is a quiet hum: if fan noise bothers you, do not get this.
Thinkpad vs IPAD (2018)
For circa 500£ (my upgraded thinkpad with 512 SSD and 16GB ram) vs 479 (Ipad with pencil) which one is better for productivity?
For simple youtube and consumption, buy the IPAD: the battery life is easily tripple the lenovo, the screen is usable, you can make notes with the apple pencil in onenote etc etc. It is a no brainer here. If you require multitasking and office support and extra connectivity options, the recommendation is more difficult to make.
I found that even with a keyboard, I simply cannot use the Ipad for everything I use my lenovo for. Several reasons:
1- The ipad can connect to a keyboard, but you cant connect a mouse. It simply isnt supported.
2- You can run multiple programs on both (and alt tab works on the ipad to switch between applications by the way), but the ipads screen is far too small to run two programs side by side. The lenovo is in the same boat: I cant use two programs side by side on a 14" screen. I have been using 27 inch screens for the last 6 years, so that may be the reason.
3- You are reliant on cloud storage with the ipad: you cannot connect any harddrives (unless its for photos only), there is no real file system. If you already only use google drive / other cloud services, this should be a problem.
4- As far as I am aware, to connect the ipad to a monitor requires a 50£ dongle, or an appletv or the airbeam app (+ a compatible monitor). Not an easy procedure at all. To connect a lenovo to a display you need  a 12£ minidisplay port to HDMI or a similar cable.
Some considerations / questions and answers for the T430.
1- Will the screen be better than the new models?:NO
2- Would the battery last as long on this T430 as the new models? definitely NO
3- Would it be more upgradable than most new machines: YES (if this is important to you)
4- Would the unit last the next 5 years, or am I buying a cheap "low performance" machine for the next year?: for non intensive use cases, I do not see a reason why this would not last you. If you require more performance than this machine can provide, get a refurb desktop at around the same price / buy a new desktop. That is the most cost efficient option.
5- Can you connect several screens to this machine?:  you can connect one 2k screen using displayport. It is possible to connect two by either using Minidisplay port and VGA OR purchasing a dock. Realistiically, I do not think the GPU would be able to drive 2 2K monitors smoothly.
6: Does this machine support RAID configurations: NO, however nothing is stopping you from settting up software raid.', '2018-11-29T17:32:52+00:00', '1', 'false', '2218', '851') ;

I suspect that the only thing done in it"s so called refurbishment has been a quick wipe over with car trim cleaner (the aroma gave that away) and installing Win 10 onto the 2014, original?

The Windows product key wasn"t recognised by MS when attempting to activate. Fortunately I was able to use an existing licence.
It did have a 9 cell battery which held a charge very well.
The optical drive needs at least three attempts before it remains closed. This has however, been replaced by a "caddy" and an additional ssd fitted.

Quite a lot, actually. On the parts of the unit that you see -- the top of the lid and the keyboard primarily -- the renovation is excellent. It"s just like new. (I"ve no idea how they do it.)
The underside of the computer has a few minor scratches, but who cares?
The performance is crisp, with the SSD enabling very brisk boots and switch-offs. This is something important on a laptop in my opinion.
The screen is good, but does not rival some of the modern stuff. The detail is there, and the colours, once corrected in the software, seem reasonably strong, but it does not exactly "pop". The angle of the screen to the eye is also quite critical for the best "viewing experience".
And, as all have agreed, the keyboard is excellent and the build quality solid.
Oh, and the "Think Light" situated next to the camera on the top bezel does its job adequately, albeit less elegantly than an illuminated keyboard.
Finally, battery life, although not formally tested by me, seems to be something of the order of 3 hours. Very acceptable for a second-hand computer, in my opinion.

I pushed the ball out of the socket and cleaned out all the fluff and gunk inside. The ball works normally again!
Update as of 29th April 2018 (1.4 years later): Over the last 2 weeks the trackball has been malfunctioning; occasionally the trackball moves extremely slowly in a random direction which only goes away if I spin the trackball sporadically several times. This has become frequent and annoying enough that I intend to buy another one. There is no apparent reason for the sudden drop in the trackball"s performance. I can"t see any fluff/dust underneath the ball when I spin it in all directions. The buttons still work normally.
Update as of 10th December 2017 (1 year later):
This mouse is still working perfectly. The ball still spins as smoothly as it did when I first used it. The mouse wheel hasn"t faltered, nor have any of the buttons.
I had to remove a small amount of fluff/dust from the ball (span the ball around, used a small amount of condensation from my breath to create traction/cohesion, pried the fluff out with a pen lid via the hole on the bottom of the mouse).
The amount of fluff which collected on the trackball over the last year was enough to cover my small fingernail.
Either the mouse"s power consumption is very low or I"ve been using powerful batteries because the batteries last for several months in this mouse (my previous computer mice needed replacing much more often).
Initial review as of circa 1st December 2016 (order date):
Works on any surface (obviously). You don"t have to move your entire forearm; the area around the mouse can be occupied by other objects as the mouse itself does not move around (only your thumb has to move in order to move the cursor; you could probably still use this if you"re missing your thumb(s)). Still as accurate as normal computer mice (simply adjust mouse sensitivity via operating system to your preferences). I became fully adjusted to using this trackball within 2 days. I can play Skyrim using this mouse just as well as with a normal mouse. I recently completed Dark Souls 3 using this trackball, so perhaps that gives some people an idea of how reliable this mouse is. Trackball carries momentum/inertia (whatever the physics term is), so you can access areas of the screen with a quick spin of the trackball (also makes it easy to do a 180-degree turn in video games). Steep price compared to normal computer mice, but I think the advantages mentioned justify the price. After experiencing what a trackball can offer, I don"t want to return to normal mice. It"s trackballs for me from now on.', '2019-02-23T17:32:52+00:00', '1', 'false', '2230', '69') ;

The wireless part is not so important on a device like this that stays put but it works fine and the claim of long battery life will hopefully be substantiated in real life. There"s a battery condition light that comes on momentarily when you first use it so I assume that will tell me in good time when the battery needs replacing.
Had years of service from my old wired version so I have high hopes for this one.
Interestingly, the name on the product just says "logi" without the "tech" and no logo.

It"s body gentle curves shaped to ergonomic perfection. The two customisable buttons (each of different shape to easily distinguish them without looking) are a real bonus. Application specific functions can be assigned to them (within certain limits). I am yet to test the makers claim that a single AA battery will last 18 months, but the on-of switch on the base certainly helps to conserve power.

The track "ball" is noisy in use. If you work in an office environment, you will not notice the noise, when you are rolling the ball. My PC is virtually silent and the roller tracker ball is noisy and distracting  (a crude and unfair example would be a hamster wheel).
Using the trackball is annoying on a 4K monitor. If I needed to  move the mouse pointer from one end of the screen to the other.  I have to keep rolling the ball, and I have to lift my thumb to reposition it. My thumb joint would have felt tired....
 I have used the Logitech software, to make setting changes, but it is n"t perfect.  If you are using a HD or similar monitor, you should be okay.
The scroll wheel could have been better.  Logitech have an amazing scroll wheel on the G502 gaming mouse. I dont know why they did n"t put that scroll wheel on the track ball mouse.

I then did some research and I ended up buying this BEAUTY.
According to Amazon order, this was MORE THAN 5 YEARS AGO. And I"m still the happiest person in the world thanks to the M570. Honestly buy it NOW.
When I first got it I was "worried" that it would have been awkward to get used to it or use it. It took me probably less than half an hour to get used to it. Now I can"t use anything else (that"s the negative of this :D).
It is a pleasure to use, it helps you because move your thumb is more natural than bend your wrist.
But the beauty of this is not just the health benefit. You"ll have more space on your desk because you"ll not need to move this around, you can now have some space next to it for your notepad. You don"t need a mouse pad or anything like that, you can even use it on your leg or whatever. It has two buttons that I personally use to GO BACK and to trigger the EXPOSE Mac feature, so very handy.
Recently a coworker of mine had also similar wrist problems and I suggested him to buy this exact thing. He did and he says he loves it too.
DURABILITY.
I concluded that this thing is indestructible. It may possibly be on par with a Nokia 3310 :P.
On few occasions I"ve accidentally spilled water on it. It"s not advisable of course but it survived the splashes.
But the worst I did to it was when once I spilled a  cup of coffee on it by accident. At first it would be fine as it already survived water as I said.
Unfortunately coffee and sugar are not good for electronics. It stopped to work...I almost panicked and almost cried (that"s how much I love it). After few hours I tried again to see if it was working and...it was! This was at least 3 years ago and this thing is still going, as said, it may well survive an nuclear war.
BATTERY LIFE
The battery will last you forever, as in HUNDREDS of days - I"m not joking. I can"t actually remember when I had to recharge the batteries. Does it needs AA batteries? I honestly can remember, it was a long time ago - let me double check.
OK, now I remember, it uses a single AA battery. I personally use a rechargeable battery, but as I said, I can"t even remember when I had to recharge it :D
"NEGATIVES"
As anything in life nothing is perfect. But this is pretty close to perfection.
There are two minor negatives to the M570. They’re more “annoyances” than anything really!
MAIN ANNOYANCE: It needs that little weird USB dongle thing. It would be great if it was just Bluetooth and work out of the box with anything.
MINOR TINY ANNOYANCE: Now and then you’ll need to take out the ball (easy peasy) and blow on the little wheels it runs on to clean them from dust, etc…it just takes few seconds really. Now and then you’ll have to clean your ball. Yep.
Seriously, thank Logitech for designing and building such a beautiful accessory which saved my wrist.', '2019-04-01T17:32:52+01:00', '0', 'false', '2230', '780') ;

The contribution in this new production of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, under the dual batons of Sally Herbert and Steve Sidwell and recorded at the Abbey Road Studio 2, is most welcome as it introduces musical moments that both compliment the original recordings and provides a new framework for a number of the songs. The Beach Boys music is naturally melodic, so nothing is taken away from their primary contribution.
It is magical to listen to their distinct voices and to have the orchestral interpolations from the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra - jaunty at the beginning of "Fun, fun, fun" and "Sloop John B", almost spiritual at the openings of "God only knows" and "You still believe in me", with rising expectation before launching into "Heroes and villains" and "Good vibrations", and quiet and thoughtful as it prefaces the slower "Disney girls" and "In my room".
The music throughout each of the numbers on the CD is enhanced by the addition of a full orchestral accompaniment and in no way undermines the singing of the group. On the contrary.

Other people jumped on board willingly.  Two of them appear shamelessly on the inner sleeve, and state their feelings of pride at having been part of this. To protect the guilty they shall remain nameless.
  The main problem with a project such as this is knowing when to hold back, and where to let the music be itself, unaltered, uncluttered.  And the answer is this:  at the beginning of every track, and until the end of every track.
  The orchestration of a few of the simpler songs - You Still Believe in Me and The Warmth of the Sun for example - don"t suffer as much as the sophisticated arrangements that Brian made for some of the songs first time round.

The highs are just a tad exaggerated, however do not sound harsh in any way, unlike some other popular brands...

The product was shipped with a malfunctioning SSD which meant that it would not boot. I didn’t know this at the time and had initially thought my daughter had interrupted the initial boot process when the laptop was first turned on. I tried unsuccessfully to install Windows 10 myself. The vendor emailed a set of generic instruction on how to do this. However, whilst I could just about manage to make the laptop boot off a USB stick. I certainly could not do it off the hard drive. The vendors advice was that I maybe install it on the hard drive!!! Really....don’t you think I’ve tried? As I customer I may have expected to be given a name or a number to contact. I was given neither.
So I took my unbootable laptop to a professional repair centre. It’s important to note that this invalidated my warranty. But they were at least able to diagnose what was ailing the laptop. What was interesting was what they found. The SSD had failed...which explained why I was unable to install Windows 10. All the paperwork that tells how well it has been tested and reconditioned; well I’m not particularly convinced it’s in anyway genuine..one more time, the SSD failed before it was used for the first time. Even better was hearing that there were several screws missing. Why this should be I’m not sure! And not that I’d have found out about this without expert help.
I did contact the vendor with what had happened and their concern was to confirm that I had indeed invalidated the warranty and would not be eligible for any form of refund
Their concern was not that they had shipped an sub standard product.
Their concern was not that their internal QC had failed.
Their concern was that I had invalidated the warranty and therefore they did not have to do anything.
I still have the faulty SSD if they want it back....I’m suspecting not.', '2018-10-02T17:32:52+01:00', '2', 'false', '231', '96') ;

Apart from that there was nothing at all wrong but I would like the company to invest a small amount of money into writing another version of there user manual that comes with the case to include other languages as unfortunately it only came in French.

Pros: Looks awesome. Material quality is high, Full ATX fits nice and snug.Nice set of screws and ties to fit everything properly. Plenty of air intakes/outlets.
Cons, Internal space is limited, and I wouldn"t recommend it for radiators 240mm or larger, they will fit but it"ll be a squeeze.

I installed an Asus RoG Strix B350-F motherboard with an AMD Ryzen 5 2600X and 16gb Corsair vengeance 2666MHz DDR4 RAM into the case. It comes with 6 motherboard standoffs already installed so you have to install another 3 if you have an ATX motherboard. I found that it was impossible to get the motherboard to line up perfectly with all of the standoffs so I ended up leaving 3 or 4 of the screws out. Even without all of the screws in, the motherboard was stuck down nice and sturdy so I don"t consider this too much of a flaw. Cable management was a dream. I pulled all of the PSU and case cables out behind the motherboard tray so that they"re all out of the central chamber of the case and not restricting airflow. Routing cables from behind the motherboard tray to each of the components was painless as there"s plenty of cutouts around the inside of the case. I noticed that there"s dust filters for almost everything on this case. The only fan that doesn"t have a dust filter is the exhaust fan but why would you want to trap dust inside your PC? Once I"d plugged everything in, the fans lit up and started spinning. Surprisingly, the three included case fans are really quiet!
To summarise, I"d give this case a 10/10 for the price. It looks great, airflow seems good despite the fans being really quiet, installing components and managing cables is really easy and it has dust filters everywhere. I"m now considering buying this case for my own PC instead of the coolermaster H500M which is a £200 case. It has a similar design for a quarter of the price. Of course, the CPU and GPU temperatures that this case can achieve will never compete with the coolermaster H500M but it"s about a quarter of the price so I"m definitely tempted. I"d recommend this case to anyone who"s not wanting to break the bank for a case but wants something functional, easy to install into, dust resistant and stylish.', '2018-12-05T17:32:52+00:00', '0', 'false', '2349', '307') ;

This was waaay above my price range but I loved how it felt. The clicky feel is so luxurious (in my opinion) and I couldn"t find anything that felt similar.
PC World had terrible returns policies - if you buy it in store you can"t return it unless it"s faulty, but they also wouldn"t let us take the keyboard out of the box to test it... so we didn"t buy from them! Fortunately, Amazon had better returns policies, but I fell in love and haven"t wanted to send it back.
I did get insurance through Amazon on it though. Around £25 for 3 years I believe, which I think is worth it for such an expensive keyboard.
The wrist support is brilliant and easy to remove (just pulls away, it"s magnetic), if it"s too big or you want to remove it for whatever reason.
IT IS NOT QUIET!!! This doesn"t bother me, in fact I quite like it, but my partner hates it as his mic picks it up when he"s streaming... oops.', '2019-03-28T17:32:52+00:00', '1', 'false', '2361', '875') ;
INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('8265', 'I"ve got to say, I was a little cautious when picking this as my next keyboard:
1, Because I"ve read negative reviews surrounding Razer and their build quality
2, Because of their switches
I had a 2014 Blackwidow tournament edition before receiving my new keyboard and still works great to this day. However, I started to feel left out with all the RGB lights and fancy switches around, so I took the plunge.
I"ve got to say, in my opinion, my concerns have not become a reality:
- First off, the Orange switches are LOVELY to type and game on, I would definitely recommend them. They have that satisfying and reassuring feel to them. After testing the keyboard with a couple of matches on killing floor 2 , the keyboard performs a dream! The switches feel accurate and comfortable to game on. I cannot give an opinion compared with Cherry switches, but they do feel really nice to use.
Secondly, the wrist rest is amazing and is a key reason I went for this keyboard instead of the Corsair range. Previously, I had to suffer from achy wrists while playing games. When choosing my next keyboard, I wanted to try and reduce that from occurring. I can say, the wrist rest is soft but firm at the same time, providing the perfect wrist support for me. After playing a few games, I am not going to lie, I was surprised to notice my wrists were not aching like they usually had.
Finally, I really like the sleek and stealth design of Razer keyboards, though an aluminum body would be nice compared with the likes of Corsairs range, the plastic does feel strong and sturdy on the Chroma V2. Additionally, the RGB backlit keys look amazing, I haven"t messed around with the Synapse software that much, but they"re really cool (From someone who has never owned a keyboard with RGB backlit keys) and the USB and audio pass-through are a nice touch, although I do not think they should be on the right of the keyboard, on the back would be better.
Would I recommend it? Yes. If you"re looking for a sleek, stealthy keyboard but also something that is equipped with a switch that is solid for gaming and typing, but offers support and comfort while doing so, then go for it!
---------------------
Bad points:
- Compared to the likes of Corsair who are offering aluminum bodied keyboards, it does feel like Razer are behind in that aspect of giving you that extra value. Yes, the K70 and K95 Plat are better value for money, but I didn"t get attached to the keycap fonts, nor the wrist rest (which looked like it would break easily). They looked like pretty awesome keyboards, but my gut was more attached to the Razer Blackwidow Chroma v2 (Whether that"s because I had a Razer before, may be, maybe not, but I can tell you I was pretty divided when hitting that order button and took a while to make up my mind.
- An extra two cables (2x USB + 1x 3.5mm audio) to plug in. I knew this before buying, but it"s quite a culture shock for me, but not an issue. All they do is allow the passthroughs to work.
- Sub-characters (if that"s the find terminology?) on the keycaps like "?" and "%" are not backlit, which is slightly annoying if you"re sitting in a darkened room, but most of the time I do not have any problem finding the right sub-character.', '2018-09-04T17:32:52+01:00', '2', 'false', '2361', '916') ;

The keyboard has a good weight to it and has a metal base which makes it feel really premium! The wrist pad that comes with it is really comfy and has a really good grip to it as well. The keyboard almost feels like it is stuck to the desk when you push against it because of the weight and the rubber pads work really well!
The lights are cool, there"s some effects I wasn"t aware of such as the fire effect where the lights simulate a fire behind the keys which is quite nice and somewhat fitting to the season!
The cable is nicely placed, it is a really thick sturdy feeling cable too with two USBs and an audio jack, I believe you only need to plug both USBs in if you want to use the built in usb port, otherwise you only need to plug in one.
The three media buttons on the top right are quite nice, it is a bit weird that they are the only keys that do not have light pass through the patterns on them.
My razer synapsis didn"t immediately detect the keyboard but that was fixed by uninstalling it and installing a newer version of the software.
The wrist pad came with a very small tear in it, it"s barely noticeable except to touch as I can feel the bump which is a shame but it is still very nice!

The day I ordered the Behringer I had just dropped and broken my previous headphones (HP1500 Pro from JBSYSTEMS) whilst broadcasting, having put them to one side on the desk they fell off and after almost 3 years one of the headphones started flopping about as the thin bit of plastic holding them in place had finally broken.
Disappointed I started searching for a new set and stumbled accross the Behringer Hpx2000.
As a volunteer for the hospital radio, a full time dad and a part time employee I was looking for a set of budget headphones that felt comfortable, sounded good and weren`t too flimsy.
With the Behringer Hpx2000 I found all three requirements - after much adjustment I found a perfect position for the headphones at which point their comfort was apparent (before that I was thinking I wouldn`t want to wear them for long periods of time), the sound from the start was very good but took some adjustment on my home stereo to balance (which gave me pause) although when plugged into the desk at the studio the sound was great straight of the bat, and the build quality seems to be really good - they are very chunky and plastic but where the headphones join to the headband is very solid indeed, leading me to believe they are solid and won`t break easily.
Don`t get me wrong, I`m no headphone expert (at least not in a technical sense), but I have been presenting for a long time now and know how I like my headphones to feel and sound, and the Behringer Hpx2000 headphones tick all the right boxes
True the lead is possibly a little short unless you`re sat next to the input socket but then again if you want to listen to a home stereo from a distance I suggest investing in a cordless set of headphones.
For me personally the Behringer Hpx2000 do exactly what a set of headphones should do and I have no problem with the sound quality at all, in fact I`m even thinking of ordering a backup set just in case, although I may also try another budget set for comparison so I can be even more objective than just comparing them to my old HP1500 Pro`s.

Behringer apparently don"t acknowledge the existence of midrange frequencies. Everything on the top end is tinny and piercing whilst the bass booms in an almost-but-annoyingly-not-quite convincing imitation of mid to sub bass.
I used them for a while (carefully, by the way: I treat all my musical gear with great care) and soon the cradle for one of the cans broke on one side. Annoying, but not detrimental as it was just repaired with gaffa tape. Soon after that, a loose connection somewhere stopped any sound coming from the left can.

The same thing happened again after another week and, being so fed up by this time, I chucked them away.

I will update the review at a later stage regarding the Rii"s long-term robustness.
After struggling, without success, to pair my Anker keyboard with my new Linx tablet (Windows 8.1, as it was on my previous tablet with which I"d been using the same Anker keyboard), I decided to give up, bite the bullet, and get a different keyboard. After a long search I decided that the Anker was actually still the best (particularly given its good price) but, obviously, I didn"t want to risk getting a new one only to find that this version of 8.1 wouldn"t deal with the Anker keyboard at all.
So I decided to try a completely different keyboard when I came across the Rii i8. It isn"t much to spend on the offchance and the reviews were good, so I took the plunge.
I"m very glad I did. The keyboard paired with the tablet immediately, without my having to do anything (including using the included dongle) other than pressing the Bluetooth connection button on the keyboard while the tablet was in pairing mode. The keyboard was recognised, and immediately started working properly.
During the set-up process of the new tablet I had to reboot frequently, as is usual. Each time the Rii keyboard was right there and ready, from the first keypress, to talk to the tablet.
The response is so good, and having a QWERTY layout is so user-friendly, that I"ve actually turned off the touchscreen facility on the tablet. Whatever I want to do (typing, recording and activating macros, mousing, cursoring, keyboard shortcuts, etc.), I can do on the Rii. If I want to control video playback there are dedicated buttons for that. All the function keys work normally - there"s nothing missing at all. This keyboard has all the functions of my full-sized desktop keyboard.
The only drawbacks are that the keyboard is US layout - but then many keyboards are so it"s easy to compensate for that because you just get used to it. Then there is the fact that I"m left-handed and the keyboard is geared for right-handers; again, so are most input devices (and everything else in the constructed world...) and I"m used to adapting. (Annoyed, but used to it...)
The keys are definite, almost "clicky" so you know when you"ve pressed them. Obviously the keyboard isn"t big enough for touch typing, but it"s definitely big enough to allow for either hunt-and-pick or the thumb-keying most people use on their smartphones.
The trackpad is probably very good - I"m so bad with trackpads that I can"t give a fair idea, except to say that I"ve found this one easier than many full-sized laptop trackpads.
There are two sets of left and right "mouse buttons", so you can decided to click left and right with one hand or with two. The mouse wheel is catered for in the centre of the trackpad, and is marked by a blue path which you can see if you look closely. There are dedicated buttons for e-mail, for muting sound, launching your browser and magnifying, plus a Windows button which can not only be used in the usual combinations such as Windows+D to get to the desktop etc., but also takes you straight to the "charms" when pressed - so much quicker than sliding from the right and then tapping.
There"s even a Ctl+Alt+Delete button! The Enter button performs this combination if used with the blue function (Fn) key - useful.
The keyboard is light (considerably lighter than my Anker) and easy to hold in all respects. It slips easily into a bag, or even a pocket or handbag. There"s a definite on/off button, so there"s no worry about keys activating something when the keyboard is tucked into a bag or pocket, and you know you"re conserving charge.
The Rii recognises all my created macros and shortkeys just as well as my full-sized (extremely expensive, completely ergonomic) keyboard, too. So all in all this is the easiest, most sure way of operating a tablet, particularly on the go, that I"ve come across.
At this price for a fully-functioning and even do-everything keyboard with total portability, you can"t lose. I"m tempted to get a separate one with a backlight to tuck into my hospital/emergency bag as well - nothing worse than being awake on a darkened ward, or in a shared room, and unable to use your tablet properly.
Do get one. Even if you decide not to use it with your tablet, look at all the other devices this amazing little keyboard will work!', '2018-09-21T17:32:52+01:00', '0', 'false', '2375', '728') ;
INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('8327', 'I bought this keyboard to use as a method of controlling a nexus 7 tablet that has developed an intermittent fault with the touch interface. I a nutshell, the device has fulfilled all I wanted it to do and more.
In more detail... The keyboard arrives in tidy and efficient packaging. The instructions are scant, but suggest charging it for 20-30 minutes before first use. I did this (off a computer USB socket, so at a lower charging rate than using a phone charger) and it took a little longer than 30 minutes to fully charge.
The keyboard is nicely built, it feels very tactile and the keys have a nice click, to provide a good feedback. I was a little concerned (before receiving the keyboard) that it would feel like typing on a ZX spectrum with that dead flesh feel, bu this really isn"t the case.
The touch pad too is nicely responsive - a little small for doing intricate work, but more than adequate for general use.
There are also two sets of left/right click buttons, which makes the layout of the keyboard extremely flexible.
Two finger scrolling works - it"s very fast, but always registers that I"m using two fingers.
I also like the pair of circular pads to the top left and top right. The top left is a media control (Up/Down is volume, left/right is previous/next and the centre button is play/pause). The top right pad is a cursor pad, where the centre button is an ok, or select button.
After 20 minutes of that charge, I paired it to my tablet and it just worked. No great detail to feedback with relation to this, but if you are looking to control an android touch device that works perfectly well other than the touch interface, I can vouch that this is a great solution (it makes the tablet a mini, wall mount PC in my case).
It would also be an ideal solution for a media centre PC or similar, where you want to carry out basic interface interactions with a PC at a distance, but don"t really want a mouse and keyboard hanging around all the time.
Don"t expect to be able to touch type with this - it wouldn"t be ideal for writing lengthy articles simply due to the size of the keyboard, but as a discrete PC/Android input device, it"s great!', '2018-12-02T17:32:52+00:00', '1', 'false', '2375', '1030') ;

I bought this 2015 New Released Bluetooth Version Rii i8 keyboard from Amazon yesterday and it works well with both my laptop and also  with the Amazon fire TVstick.
If you intend using it on a fire TV stick you do need a bit of knowledge about side loading apps because you must first download a "settings apk" and side load it onto the fire tv before you can install the keyboard, details if needed will more than likely be found on YouTube
It pairs with the new 4K Fire tv box simply by the main menu without the need to sideload the settings apk.
Make sure you buy the bluetooth keyboard if intending to use it on a fire tv stick and not the other 2.4GHz RF version that has a USB dongle because it"s not Bluetooth and will NOT work.

I have been using it with my Android tablet, with my Android phone, and with the built in Bluetooth of my Raspberry Pi 3
Things I like:
* form factor, the device is a good size in the hand, and is comfortable to use. I think probably better than those with the touchpad at one end.
* size, it"s only slightly bigger than my phone
* texture, it has a smooth / soft finish
* it comes with a USB Bluetooth adaptor, if your desired device lacks built in Bluetooth (which fits neatly inside the battery cover when not in use)
* the keys feel nice to type with, although obviously not as good as a full size keyboard
* it"s a pretty complete keyboard, not just letters. I am able to admin my server via SSH on my tablet using tilde (~) and pipe (|) etc.
Things I don"t like:
* lack of back light, maybe I should have got the newer version, but I was keen to have Bluetooth
* Mini USB for charging, rather than the more common Micro. Means I need a specific cable to charge this keyboard, rather than the many Micro USB I already have for phones, my mouse, etc.
* Touch pad scrolling is a bit hit and miss. things tend to jump about a lot unless you hold with one finger and move the other by very small amounts
Tips:
* [Fn] + [space] toggles the touch pad speed, which was far too slow for me to start with
* You don"t need to use the mouse buttons, just tap the pad to click
It turns itself off is not used for a while, hit a key and it wakes up (no need to use the power switch)

The production on the recordings is fine.
At first listen I could see what so many people have complained about.
I discovered thankfully if the album is given a listen on good speakers/headphones/earphones at a lower volume, it shines, no fuzziness, raspiness or distortion.
Just thought I"d put that out there first.
As per the style of Foo Fighters songs so far Concrete and Gold has moments you"d hear a pin drop, and bursts of guitar & vocal -laden chaos that only after several listens can you choose to follow the vocals or another element of that chaos, but it is a calculated, reined-in chaos.
Catchy songs such as The Sky Is a Neighborhood guarantee the album won"t fade into obscurity, a number promised to land in the charts, and some heartfelt songs, melancholic, reflective, angry, hopeful - everything fans love about the Foos.
With 8 albums in the rear-view you can always be sure Foo Fighters are here to stay.
And while the music industry is a hungry, greedy beast, Dave & Co. manage to feed the monster while slipping some genuine dishes under its radar, too.
When the price of success has been Learn To Fly, Break Out and a few other mainstream, almost "pop-rock" releases, Foos in their heart are rock-metal.
Concrete and Gold is another welcomed addition to the Foo Fighters catalogue.

For prolonged use these headphones are comfy, and will enclose my ears instead of partially trapping them, even with my glasses on. I consider my ears relatively average size, so would like to think this would be the case for most people, but it"s worth trying them if possible. They are very secure in my head, I wouldn"t say tight, but hold enough that I can play like a madman on my drums and headbang along without them falling off - which would lead me to think that if they do sit over part of your ear they would get uncomfortable with long periods of wearing.
The cans come with a nice long cable, with your 3.5 audio jack as standard for mp3 players and phones, and a screw in larger phono adaptor for plugging into most other things, including some guitar amps, or my other electric drums =).

These are not manufactured in Austria anymore they are made in China, there is a slight but not at first glance difference.
The reason for the 3 stars is
1. AKG selling point is not only sound quality, but comfort and for every pair of AKGs Ive owned (other than these) I can concur  that even after a twelve hour stint there is no comfort issue and the quality of sound has always been good.  Weather its been with a low or high priced pair.
These on the other hand are very uncomfortable,  the provided ear pad are tiny,  I have small ears and they just fit, the head band is too tight - makes you feel like your head is in a vice. the actual driver is way too close to your ear and it gets very hot, you"ve got to take them off after 20 mins.  Ive put some pads on from an old pair of AKGs and they for me more comfortable.
2. The Mute does not always work.
3 Sound quality wise,  I find them no better than e.g. the K92 which are far less money and very comfortable.  This is just my personal opinion, if you compare the two on paper the k271 have a slightly wider dynamic range. However paper can hear.
On the plus side, the mini XLR and two different cables for me are a welcome addition, In a studio environment it is easy to get headphone cables caught up in chair wheels and break the cable and have to bin a good pair of headphones.
There is no sound leak,  A quick example, if Im wearing the K271s and turn a power amp to full volume and blast some sound out of monitors I cant hear it.', '2019-04-02T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '2388', '359') ;

The bass,  using the supplied velour earpads is rich, tight and deep, the midrange,while being less full than the Sennheisers, is crisp and incisive. This slight leanness in the lower mid might well  contribute to the impression that they are slightly tighter than the Senheisers. The treble, however is very bright indeed, and reveals all the detail in a recording, warts and all. It can give the impression , of being slightly disorganised particularly with rock music. but this quality is largely benign and not intrusive. They also create a good sense of space,considering that they are closed-back headphones, and image well too, which seems to be largely down to the bright, incisive treble.

Trump, the real surprise here is that the legendary singer chooses to devote much of this new album to respond to him and this era of intense political controversies. Over the course of its 11 tracks, the album"s tone switches between despair and rage to rail against what has happened to a country once strong and full of hope. Amidst the gorgeously-arranged tracks, her magnificent voice remains the main attraction, and even though the songwriting is occasionally not as impressive as Ms Streisand"s vocal abilities, the sincerity of this project can break down someone"s cynical defences. In the past I was sceptical whenever artists became political in their work, but since Madonna"s exceptional "American life" album, I am more open to similar projects. In contrast to that record, there is no musical ground to break here, but I appreciate Barbra"s intention to offer something fresh to her audience. The absolute standout track for me is "Lady liberty", wonderfully encapsulating the essence of both this set and Streisand herself. And I love how she has chosen to close the set with two tracks that sprinkle some hope around. Which is what this album ultimately seems to be about: finding some reason to persevere during a period of political uncertainty.

Barbra’s vocals are phenomenal!
Ever since I heard the opening lines to 1994’s As if I never said goodbye Babra’s vocal grabbed me in, hook, line and sinker!
This album is original and has some standout pieces for me....
Don’t lie to me is upbeat and thought provoking,
Lady Liberty is wonderful and having climbed my way to the top of Libery’s crown I feel the lyrics shine bright from her lantern.
Better Angels gave me goosebumps and also a tear in its deliver, power and sentiment. It made me think about those who i’ve loved and lost.
What the world needs now is beautifully performed with a different mix on the original.
Happy Days....is tough one as it’s not necessary my favourite of Barbra’s but this version stirs both optimism and a sense of loss for the current state of the world.
If Trump make Babrba sing this well, i’d happily take him having another term in office.

Weaving a blend of thoughtful lyrics with a tightly refined collaborative effort with different guest stars, Assume Form is an intelligently written album, one that only gets better with repeat listens.
Beginning with the self-titled Assume Form, the first track snatches you up and takes you on a musical journey through Indie, Electronica and Hip-Hop influenced pop. The ambient, moody instrumentals complement James’ lyrical prowess perfectly and there’s a harmony here between the vocals and production that really brings the best out of this album.
There’s a real crispness to the vocals too, with a minimal use of distortion and reverb to really get the best out of this talented vocalist’s range. Although there are a few songs that utilize the dreaded auto-tune, the effect is minimal at best and easy to look past. The use of electronic instruments is a nice inclusion though and there’s an almost discordant feel to some of the tracks but the way these fade into the background, giving way to James Blake’s vocals ultimately overshadow any issues here.
The album showcases a really interesting musical journey too, constantly evolving into different genres and tones throughout the 12 tracks. What begins as a slow-paced vocal ride suddenly slams into hard-hitting hip hop before exploring some interesting musical arrangements and closing out on the reflective and lyrically poignant Lullaby For My Insomniac.
There are a few stand out tracks here including Into The Red and Barefoot In The Park but Andre 3000’s guest appearance on Where’s The Catch is really the brightest star in a glittery backdrop of individual triumphs. The hard-hitting beat works in-sync with Andre’s rapping and as the album heats up, Blake’s smooth vocals soothe the burn and mellow the album back into pleasant pop-fuelled waters.
Assume Form is the sort of album that benefits from repeat listens too. As a straight forward journey from start to finish, the album does well to keep the tone feeling fresh and original throughout. Upon listening to different tracks again with a fresh pair of ears, you really get a sense of the scale and ambition the album strives for (and mostly achieves). The subtle echoes of different genres, the great vocals and tight productions all combine to make Assume Form the best album of 2019 so far and a tough one to beat going forward.', '2018-07-13T17:32:52+01:00', '2', 'false', '2464', '1105') ;

I mention this only to say I listen at such an audiophile level thatany weaknesses in the chain would be revealed glaringly.
When people suggest the AKG K240s have weaknesses I suggest they do not, they are made for studio use to reveal weaknesses in the recording chain. In my experience of Stax,Audeze, Sennheiser, Beyerdynamic  et etc the AKG 240s are THE ONLY headphone I have used that do not have inherent weaknesses, but purely reveals them. Considering the thousands of pounds I have spent/auditioned on headphones their cost is truly remarkable.
Misconceptions:-
They don"t have bass - any headphone that extends to 15hz has more bass depth than humans can hear. I have recordings electronic keyboard tracks with 20 hz basslines, the lowest humans or CD can do and these are clearly audible on my system as are 20hz tones.
 You may not have a system that can reproduce these, you may not like the "correct" bass levels studio headphones give, but they clearly do have deepbass if not in any exaggerated amount.
They have too much treble - well not if you go to concerts and listen to live cymbals they don"t. You may have a system that does not reproduce treble perfectly, but if you do the K240s reproduce it perfectly.
So I would say blame your equipment, blame your recordings, blame your ears, but don"t blame your K240s. Are they totally perfect headphones ? No. The original cushions are too uncomfortable for long sessions, but £25 Beyerdynamic 990 pads cure that. The original cable is not up to standard, but you can buy a Van Damme OFC pro cable with neutrik plugs for £30. Does this make it perfect? Well in 40 years of serious listening it is as close as anything I"ve heard comes if partnered to the best equipment. And for a total of £125 for
headphones, pads & cable that makes it an absolute  bargain when it surpasses everything I"ve owned/heard at ten times the cost & more.

The deal breaker was the feel on my head. I"m 6ft 3 and though more comfortable than others, after 30 mins the back of my head and ears were just getting to hot and pressurised for comfort. My conclusion is that for some large cans will be fine but for others they just will be an ordeal.

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('8561', 'I ordered this headphones due to great expert reviews. I use them for mixing. I"M used to all sort of headphones and studio monitors.
This AKG"s are not expensive compared to sound quality they give. I use them for mixing, video editing, background music listening and dedicated music listening. I plug them on my Smartphone to listen to the radio station, iPod, PC, TV... They give similar quality sound out of any source (even from smartphone which is rather lower quality, and I rarely listened it, before this AKG"s. It"s OK for radio stations though).
CONS: The actual built quality is very fine, but they look like a cheap clone of some premium product. Much cheaper consumer phones I have looks more premium than these. But this is pure aesthetic opinion. Who looks at them while in darkened studio :)
PROS (just some of it): I praise mostly the flat response throughout whole spectrum. This is only headphone I have which do not need EQ adjustment.
I like how easy and "polite" sound this headphone produce. I mean they make smooth and pleasant sound even with MP3"s, and I like to listen very complex music through them, which I would never on lower quality phones.
They are comfortable! I"m prone to headache because of headphones, if they are not over ear and big enough. AKG provide vinyl and velour ear pads. I could not decide which are more comfortable. I ended using vinyl on one side and velour on other. I can"t tell the difference. Even after long time sweat is on both side. Maybe a drop less on velour side. But I do not sweat much under these. Opposite to other phones I have. It means great spare ear pads already included :)
Cable: There are two of them. Again good. I can change connection on headphone rather than on hard to reach PC output when I work on a PC. Other twisted cable I use for all other uses, because it is shorter. Cable is bulky and heavy compared to consumer products, a bit hard too. But I believe it will last long. But I can always buy new one, since phones have XLR mini connector.
Self adaptive overhead strap is comfortable. I"m bald and very sensitive on top of my head. Most other phones gives me pain after hour or so. I often forget them on while working on PC, even after I"m done with what I listened.
Great product and even Amazon delivery was faster than estimate.
EDIT: After 4 months of usage I must take ONE STAR away from my initial review due to wearing comfort. I do not sweat under either of pads, but head and ears becomes so worm under and I"m prone to get headacke after a while. This is more prominent with vinyl pads. Pads are rather hard and unpleasant on skin. Under ears where no hair grows they soon stick to skin. While velour pads gives me better feel on skin and they worm up inside less, they also have smaller inside diameter (they are thicker padded) which means that they are not all around the ears but presses on my ears at edges which starts to hurt me after while. Workaround is to move them around a bit to "catch" ears inside pads. But that makes another problem: Velour part of pads are heat-glued together with plastic inner part where seams would be in vinyl pads, in the middle of inside diameter. That "seam" is quite hard with sharp edges, so sometimes it hurts me. I wish pads would be made out of better quality or even leather (I would buy upgrade pads if I knew they were better quality).
Other negative is very heavy and sturdy coiled cable, because much of the weight is concentrated on short lenght. Coiled part begins 60 cm after headphone, which is just fine if you sit at the table. Than all weight lays on the table. But soon as you move coiled part falls down and than all weight is on one side of head. I tend to change cable depend on usage. While straight cable is soft and light, coiled one is hard, sturdy and heavy. Probably good for some rough enviroment, but for calm studio work I wish lighter and more flexible cable (as straight is). I still rather use coiled one, because is shorter.
Using this hard cable becomes a problem if connected to some portable device (iPod or smarthpone), because its heavier than device and device tends to fall from desk if cable fells on my knees while seating.
Maybe I"m picky but I found myself that I do not use this phones as much as I thought. Often I use "regular" HiFi phones of I do not mix, because they are more comfortable.
PS: some claims that this phones are hard to drive. That is correct to some level. Fore professional gear there is no problem. But if connected on PC internal sound card, sound will not be powerfull. I own Brainwawz AP001 headphone amplifier. That make whole difference on PC output. And not so much difference in iPod. So it depends on device output.

I"m far from a basshead, but I can safely say these cans are anemic in the bass department, and I am returning them for this reason.
I ordered these cans along with Beyerdynamic DT 770s (which are closed-back headphones) because both piqued my interest and couldn"t decide which one to get. So I decided to test both together, keep one and return the other. My laptop has crappy onboard sound, so I also ordered a FiiO K1 USB DAC, which despite its cheap price point, has excellent sound, virtually indistinguishable from the sound of my iPod (which is known to have a great internal DAC). Disclaimer: Other than that, my experience with premium headphones comes from listening to my trusty Sennheiser HD 598s for many years, which I regrettably don"t have with me and cannot be part of this comparison.
My testing method involved many several hours" worth of repeating various ~10-second passages over and over, quickly switching between both headphones and listening for the differences, using dozens of songs from many different genres. While both headphone"s sound signatures are surprisingly similar to my ears (and both are meant to be analytical headphones for studio use), the k240 is glaringly lacking in bass power by comparison. Even simple kick drums lack almost all thump, blending in with non-percussion instruments. I"m not at all a basshead (I mostly listen to progressive/alternative rock and instrumental/classical music), but between two headphones that otherwise sound quite similar, but one of them lacks something, of course I"m going to pick the one that doesn"t lack it.
The k240 does have a slightly wider soundstage (turns out the DT 770 has pretty good soundstage despite its closed design!), but it"s not enough to compensate the bass anemia. This is not a genre-specific issue: even orchestral music is affected by this problem, for even something as simple as a marching band drum will lack "oomph" on these cans.
As the final nail in the coffin, even the earbuds that came with my phone have fuller bass than these cans.', '2018-10-04T17:32:52+01:00', '0', 'false', '25', '1150') ;

Sound is extremely good, especially for the price. It is exactly what it says on the tin - balanced and accurate. Trebles, mids and bass are all reproduced well and neither exceed nor lack in any area. The bass increase setting on my FiiO E10 works very well for when you want a more bassy sound - but it sounds great normally.
The sound is very clear and many details in your music will be brought out. I was surprisingly impressed by the sound stage which is quite large and airy, probably due to the semi-open design. You don"t feel the music is inside your head which is something I personally dislike. This also means that those nearby will hear your music, so bear that in mind. It"s not noise cancelling either so you will be able to hear your surroundings.
At 55ohms impedance it"s fairly easily driven. It"s comfortably loud at half volume on low amplification setting on a Fii0 E10. It doesn"t need an amp for most situations but a good headphone amp will certainly bring the best out of it. Everything is clearer and generally better.
It"s very comfortable to wear, one of the most comfortable headphones I"ve tried. It is very light and does not strongly clamp your head. It feels like you could wear it all day.
Build and design is fairly good. It"s not particularly pretty but it"s for listening to not looking at. It feels a little flimsy and feels it could break if twisted or pulled too much, but this shouldn"t be a problem if you look after it. It doesn"t creak however and feels generally well made - it"s just light.
You get a decent length 3.5mm straight cable and a coiled cable. It comes standard with leatherette ear pads and an alternative pair of velvet ear pads. Both are comfortable. You also get a 6.5mm jack adapter.

The fact that you can change the cord is a very handy feature- I have gone for the telephone style coil and have never had any problems.
As for the sound they are fantastic- I would say the bass is very subtle compared to some of the headphones I have used (there is a review on here saying that the low end is overpowering- they MUST have been reviewing the wrong headphones) but it works well as it makes a lot more room for mid and high frequencies. I was looking for something fairly flat with regards to frequency response and I think these are ideal, but admittedly I haven"t tried a great deal of pro headphones.

From the first track “This Land” it’s obvious that Gary is continuing his move away from straight blues to a more contemporary R&B-friendly sound, although the following “What About Us” is in fact very bluesy, with ‘fuzzy’ production (courtesy of Gary himself and Jacob Sciba) and some interesting lead guitar.  There are nice guitar parts throughout the album but the emphasis is more on the groove and the lyrics, which are a lot more political and heartfelt.  The haunting “I Walk Alone” features a falsetto vocal, as do the funky “Feed the Babies” and “Pearl Cadillac”, which also has some stinging Texas blues guitar - a combination that reminds you a bit of Prince.  “Gotta Get Into Something” is pure rock and roll, like Chuck Berry for 21st. century, while “Feelin’ like a Million” is a catchy reggae and R&B mashup (again with some nice guitar).
“Got to Get Up” features Gary’s blues guitar over a modern R&B (sampled?) backing – quite effective – and I really liked the old-style soul sounds of both “When I Get Home” and “The Guitar Man”.  With “Low Down Rolling Stone” we are back to the blues, albeit a modern melodic blues, whereas “The Governor” is old-style blues with acoustic slide guitar and a thumping drum accompaniment.  Closely followed by “Don’t Wait Til Tomorrow” more modern R&B complete with samples before the album finishes with “Dirty Dishes Blues” – ‘yer actual 12-bar blues featuring just Gary and his guitar – just like he started off.  The bonus tracks are “Highway 71” an instrumental featuring wah-wah guitar and “Did Dat” another Prince-style song, nice enough but at nearly seven minutes long it overstays its welcome somewhat.
I’d seen this album billed as Gary leaving the blues behind for more contemporary sounds and political messages but there is still a blues base to everything that he does and I like to hear him take chances and mix it up.  There are straight blues here but there is also much more – terrific variety and while the guitar may not be quite so prominent as in the past it is still there bubbling away under most tracks and his vocals are also very good throughout.

His repertoire was varied to be sure and sometimes he really nailed it but his albums were always a bit of a hit and miss affair although he was seemed to deliver live and the concert albums testify to that.
With a certain amount of trepidation I approached this new album and yet again he fails to convince me, some of the material is excellent and worth hearing again and again, the reggae infused "Feelin" Like a Million" and the punky "Gotta Get Into Something" and the soulful "When I"m Gone" are winners but so many of the R&B funky songs all sound the same.. It seems he would rather be the new Prince than Jimi and as such the guitar echoes these heroes and is no bad thing just predictable.
The Hendrix thing is palpable on a couple of songs, the wah wah infused instrumental "Highway 71 and the Experience sounding "Low Down Rolling Stone" but neither are that memorable but in context are welcome.
There are perhaps only two blues songs on this long album the acoustic driven "The Governor" and the delta blues "Dirty Dishes Blues" but these are merely token offerings and some tracks at the end are just throwaway filler.
I guess we expected more but if he is happy following his own path who are we to disagree.
I would however draw your attention to the newly released video that accompanies the title song "This Land" a powerful highly charged piece that puts a certain perspective to things over in "Trump" land and I would hesitate to make further comment for fear of being misconstrued but it is certainly worth seeing.', '2018-08-10T17:32:52+01:00', '2', 'false', '2780', '873') ;

The mouse works perfectly fine for the average user browsing the web. No real complaints at all. For the price you really can"t expect much, but it"s surprisingly ergonomic (Although this obviously varies per person), surprisingly well made and it also works straight away on both windows 7 + 10.
If you"re the sort of person who "sometimes" uses photoshop, does a little word processing or web design etc then it may not be "just" as good a buy. There is an ever so slight "dead spot" if you slowly move the mouse, which leaves the cursor immobile on screen. Also the scroll wheel sometimes doesn"t register.
But these two above points are still acceptable if you only do the odd bit of that kind of work. If you did that kind of work more regularly/seriously then it would probably be less acceptable. Anything other than pro work, it"s great!', '2019-01-25T17:32:52+00:00', '2', 'false', '2833', '1014') ;

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('8968', 'I felt I was in need of a new laptop as my previous Inspiron was over 8 years old.
The product I"m reviewing is Dell Inspiron 17" 5000 (Intel Core i7-8550U Processor) - I thought I"d clarify this as the reviews here are for range of different processors and screen sizes.
The build quality of the laptop is pretty reasonable. It"s all plastic but it"s not super glossy like my old Inspiron so it looks less tacky.
The fan was pretty noisy at first but I think a Dell/Windows update has downloaded and fixed this.
Start-up time is incredible - it takes around 20-30 seconds max from hitting the power button to logging in to Windows 10. The finger print sensor login is a nice touch too.
Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity seems to work flawlessly.
I was dreading the switch from Windows 7 to Windows 10 but it"s been quite a nice experience so far. Things like Calendar synchronisation and Cortana are nice touches. I"m not sure yet if Cortana will replace my trusty Google Now / Assistant on my phone but we"ll see. Some of the "apps" you can get are pretty nifty too, such as WhatsApp for desktop which allows you to view and reply to your WhatsApp messages without having to pick up your phone.
Now - the main thing I was worried about - the SCREEN.  I"d read dozens of reviews where the screen quality was a big bone of contention. I can safely say that I worried over nothing - the screen is OK. One of the gripes is that it isn"t bright enough.  I think one issue here is that most people have their TV"s and other screens cranked up to full brightness, which is not what you"re supposed to do (full brightness is supposed to be for display mode in shops to make the screen "pop" and stand out under the bright florescent lights). As I type this I currently have my screen brightness set to 50% and it looks fine to me. If the sunlight were really bright I know I"ve got the option to turn the brightness up further.
Comparing the screen to a good quality external HP monitor that I have running alongside, the colour representation is also pretty good. I"m doing design work on this screen and it"s adequate for me. If you"re doing specialist photo editing then perhaps you might take issue with it, but then again you"d most likely be using an external monitor anyway.
Finally, be warned, there is quite a bit of backlight bleed around the edges and corner of the display when you"re on a black screen. If you"re watching a movie with lots of dark or shadowy scenes, particularly at night, this could be annoying. For me this isn"t a problem as I don"t really watch movies on my laptop. I also bought a 40" Samsung TV a few years ago with a similar amount of backlight bleed and clouding and I vented so much frustration over this back then, that I no longer really care.
One tip - after booting it up for the first time, via the Windows Defender Security Centre I selected the "Fresh Start" option. This removes all of the rubbish and bloatware that Dell includes on the system by default and starts with a reasonably clean Windows install. Afterwards you can update all of the device drivers manually, or download the Dell SupportAssist application from the Dell website which will do this for you. After doing this things run as smooth as ever. I uninstalled some bizarre games that Microsoft includes by default, and cleared out all temporary files and restore points via the Disk Cleanup utility, which freed up an extra 10GB of space on the SSD hard drive.
All in all I"m pleased with this system. I looked at a HP equivalents which I liked because their laptop bodies were made from metal rather than plastic. However, it they were more expensive and some models weren"t as well spec"d as the Dell.', '2018-10-03T17:32:52+01:00', '2', 'false', '2962', '1063') ;

Came charged, but will be charging a bit overnight and seeing how long that lasts, not had any issues yet though. The scroll wheel is something I"ll get used to, however it us very different from anything I"ve used before, louder too. The thumb scroll was invaluable to me as an video editor, allowing me to scrub the timeline with that, making it a breeze.

The free-wheel scroll wheel is a revelation for someone who"s work involves scrolling through long pages of computer code all day, just give it a strong flick and it instantly unlocks from the usual "notches" to free-wheeling, speeding up / down whole pages in no time.
Also I wasn"t expecting the gesture button to be as useful as it is!  Default settings are press it down to show all applications open to allow quick switching between applications (same as pressing "Windows Key & Tab" in Windows), but hold it down and drag mouse down to minimise everything and show desktop (there are also pre-configured gestures for left, right and up).  All the defaults are useful, but using the downloaded software you can configure all the buttons and gestures to do nearly anything!  What a revelation!
The thumb wheel feels quality, there is a little resistance to it since it feels quite nicely heavy, but I think this gives greater control.  Unfortunately I don"t have to scroll sideways too often, but if you do you should find it very satisfying to use!
All in all it"s a very comfy mouse for people like me with slightly larger hands, although I don"t know how well smaller-handed people would get on with it!  It is the largest mouse I"v ever owned. I do love the thumb rest (including the gesture button) and the way the whole mouse (the usual 2 mouse buttons at least) slants down to the right like most good ergonomic mice.  My only gripe is that there is nowhere to rest your ring and little fingers if you use your first and middle fingers to operate the usual 2 mouse buttons!  They just have to kind of dangle down by the side, ever so slightly uncomfortably.  If you use your middle finger to operate the scroll wheel and your right-hand ring finger to operate the right mouse button it is more comfortable, but I would have liked a dint or something to rest my ring and little fingers.
Considering the quality and all of the other benefits of this mouse the complaint is a relatively minor one, but one that stops me giving it the full 5 stars.
All in all it"s a pleasure to use and if you"ve only ever used cheapish mice before you will almost certainly not regret upgrading to this beast!', '2018-08-27T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '3005', '836') ;

The buttons are beautifully recessed with the body and have smooth actions.
To conserve power you can manually turn the mouse off, as well as switch between one of three connected Bluetooth devices. It comes with a standard Logitech wireless dongle, but operates just fine with the built in Bluetooth that most modern computers come equipped with, which is great if USB ports are at a premium to you!
When you connect to a computer you also get the option to install some Logitech management software to fine tune the mouse. Essentially it gives you total control over the DPI, smooth scrolling and even whether you want the middle scroll-wheel to feel like a ratchet (feel the clicks as you scroll) or feel like a flywheel (smooth-as-silk scrolling that carries on effortlessly).

I saw the AMZ (Amazon) version of the Logitech MX mouse for an absolute bargain on a Black Friday/Cyber Monday deal and simply couldn"t resist.
The Amazon version of the product comes in a small carboard box with simply the basics inside to get you up and running. Like many products these days it doesn"t come with any software so you need to download it manually. Fortunately with Windows 10 the "Logitech Options" software installed automatically. However, as other people have pointed out the software is very much lacking in "Options".
I find the position of the thumb buttons too far back for me to comfortably use them so it"s likely I won"t use those. The applications I use for productivity, i.e. Visual Studio and PowerShell Studio won"t benefit much from the thumb scroll wheel. I could see that content creators using Adobe products will probably benefit from it quite heavily though. I thought I could possible repurpose the thumb wheel to provide other functionality but unfortunately the Logitech Options software gives you very few options to chose from.
I used the mouse for a few days and whilst I really like some elements of it, it really is a terrible mouse for any kind of FPS or RPG gaming. I don"t use lots of other mouse buttons when I do play games, just the regular left, right and middle + the wheel suffice for me. However, the tracking speed of this mouse is very slow, even on full speed, and occaisionally the pointer jumps when moving very slowly which is also a problem for games.
I didn"t buy this mouse for gaming, in fact, far from it, but it has made what little game playing I do very frustrating and therefore I don"t think it"s the right mouse for me.
Pros:
- The AMZ "Amazon" version is great value for money
- Decent build quality
- Excellent battery life
- Both Bluetooth and Logitech Unifying receiver connectivity
- Can be connected to mulitple devices
- Ratchet/Free spin mouse wheel is a great feature
- Works on pretty much any surface
Cons:
- It"s definitely NOT for gaming as the pointer speed is far too slow for gaming, even on max speed and occaisionally jumps about when moving very slowly
- Position of thumb buttons makes them difficult to use for my hands
- Middle mouse button can be difficult to press without activating the wheel movement
- Very limited configuration options available with the "Logitech Options" software
- Nowhere on/inside the mouse to store the Logitech Unifying receiver which could be easily be misplaced
- No charging cradle so needs to be connected with a USB lead to charge', '2018-10-19T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '3005', '240') ;

The only "downside" is that the main wheel doesn"t have a rocker, but instead there is a second wheel on the side, so if you"re used to rocking the wheel to the side, then it takes a little bit of use to get used to the new control method.

A very ergonomic mouse - fit"s perfectly in my average sized hand. The buttons (left/right) are very responsive with a good feel.
BUTTONS
There are 2/3 extra buttons. Behind the side-scroll wheel is a "2 button" element for back and forward thru pages. More discreet and easy to miss is the button under the thumb-rest. This can be programmed to do any number of things. I keep my software environment simple so have not installed the logitech software. So I can"t speak for the use of these buttons, but I can say they are easily reached and responsive.
SCROLL WHEEL
Some hate it but I love the "flywheel" scroll - it"s one of the main reasons I stuck with Logitech (from owning an m500). Previously you had "free wheel" which spins for ages and scrolls through many pages of documents/web etc. Or "normal" scroll, with a notched "click" response as you roll the wheel. With this MX Master, the "normal" notched scroll remains, but if you flick the wheel in this mode it "unlocks" and spins. Tap the wheel again and it "locks" again so scrolling stops. Very clever and useful. Press the button behind the scroll wheel and it goes into "always free" fast and frictionless spin - which is where I have it 90% of the time.
SIDE SCROLL
I use it for web dev and graphic design, so side-scroll was also important.  Sadly the mouse falls a bit short here. The thumb wheel doesn"t project far and I find my thumb simply slips over it - it doesn"t turn at all. I need to "pinch", so end up clicking the left button when I don"t want to. Or I have to move my thumb back and "point inwards" to gain any purchase on the wheel - very awkward, making it easier just to go back to keyboard/mouse combinations. If the side scroll had a "loose flywheel" setting this mouse would be perfect.
SURFACES
For sensitivity it"s very good - works on any surface as it promises. Being wireless the DPI will never be amazing, but it"s accurate enough for me and adjustable without additional software.
CHARGE
I love that it can charge while in use, so no down-time. Not had it long, but I"m 3 days in on one charge.
CONNECTING
You get a receiver for wireless. Unfortunately nowhere to store it. My other Logitech has a slot to keep it safe. Now I have a tiny component and nowhere to put it.
I"m using bluetooth to a MAC. It connected first time and has had no issues, no drop-outs. One small point is that the manual says to press the "connect" button - but there isn"t one. Just turn it on and it connects on its own.
You can connect to 3 devices, with a button to cycle through the devices on the base of the mouse.

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('10740', 'Much has changed in the world of In Flames since they emerged in 1990, the band continuously refining and streamlining their sound (often in the face of fierce opposition) as they evolved and matured from their early years as melodic death metal pioneers. Incorporating electronic elements and even gothic touches, Siren Charms and Battles proved to be impressive outings for the band and, arguably, for every fan the band chased off with their increasingly melodic stylings, they gained two more (certainly, if the ecstatic crowd of sounds from the heart of Gothenburg is anything to go by). Now back with their thirteenth album, the band trailed a tougher sound than heard on the previous two outings, but although the album as a whole does have considerable heft, it actually feels like the spiritual and sonic sequel to the impressive battles, the band consolidating the melodic excursions of that record whilst allowing for some tougher, diamond-edged riffing to emerge across the album’s thirteen tracks.
Opening with subtle, ambient synths and a stair-stepping guitar riff that could as easily be lifted from early U2 as anything in metal, once it builds its head of steam, Voices emerges as a tough, dynamic lead-track complete with guttural vocals and a slight, industrial edge. With a gleaming, metallic production more reminiscent of come clarity than anything the band have released recently, voices still can’t resist a huge chorus, whilst the melodic lead break that soars across the latter half of the track is similarly hook-laden. It gets things off to an impressive start and shows that In Flames have lost none of their flair for combining seismic riffs with insanely catchy hooks. Keeping things at the heavier end of the spectrum, I, the mask offers no subtle intros, bursting out of the speakers with a rage that is genuinely surprising. A powerful song, it’s undone a touch by the fact that the chorus comes perilously close to plagiarising the band’s own the end from battles, although, if you’re going to borrow one of the previous album’s riffs, it makes sense to make sure it is one of the highlights. A good example of In Flames doing what they do best – pairing Titanic riffs and massive hooks; it is, nonetheless, one of the album’s weaker tracks, but it is followed by the crunchy call my name, a track which would comfortably fit on either battles or siren charms with its gleaming production and soaring, yearning vocals. A track that really hits home when played loud, the sweet riffs with which the band pepper the song and the heavier vocals pack quite a punch on the latter half of the track. Then there’s the blistering I am above to contend with. Here, the band deftly move from a claustrophobic verse that coils itself up before lashing out at the listener, to an arena-sized chorus. It should feel incongruous, but In Flames are nothing if not masters of this sort of thing, and the track will undoubtedly have live audiences eating out of the palms of their hands. In contrast, follow me, with its acoustic intro and atmospheric synths, really takes its time to unfurl and it’s a great song – the mid-paced music with its harmonised vocal truly earning the soaring chorus that emerges. The first half of the record comes to an end with future anthem (this is our) house, which opens with massed vocals screaming defiance before plunging into a swirling maelstrom of dark riffing. It’s a cracking track which perfectly pitches melody and aggression and it brings the first half of the record to a close on an emotional high.
Opening the second half of the record, we will remember is a mid-paced track that is very typical of In Flames’ recent output. With a shimmering lead giving way to a chunkier riff, it soon breaks down to a more sedate pace in order to allow the melodies to shine through. Throbbing bass synths underpin the slower in this life. Less immediate, it’s a track that places the emphasis primarily on the vocals and the guitars are necessarily muted in their approach. In contrast burn ups the tempo considerably, but it is the stunning deep inside that stands as the highlight of the album’s second half. With subtle eastern elements woven into the track’s atypical riff, along with deftly-layered vocals, deep inside is a perfect example of modern-day In Flames firing on all cylinders. Opening with a naked vocal, all the pain places emotion front and centre, and although the guitar work that simmers underneath the verse is well-worn, the overall outlook is more atmospheric with elements of the Cure incorporated into the verses. It’s another example of where less is more and, when the track does finally explode, it feels all the more powerful for it. The album officially ends with stay with me, a track awash with the quasi-orchestral sounds of the Mellotron and sensibly-led by acoustic guitars. It brings the album to an emotional close and, as the band slowly allow it to edge into heavier territory, the only slight disappointment is that it fades out rather than comes to a definitive end. Whatever, the melody haunts the listener long after the record has spun to a stop.  As is now typical, physical editions come with a bonus track (available on both the digi-pack and the cool double vinyl, which comes complete with pop-up artwork) entitled not alone. A track that draws upon eighties influences, the low vocal on the verse and heavy synth elements sounding like a cross between Men Without Hats and Sisters of Mercy, not alone is a really cool bonus, even if it does unpick some of the emotional resonance of stay with me.
Having very much enjoyed both Siren Charms and Battles, I was intrigued to see how In Flames would progress on I, the mask, especially with the band making much of having returned to heavier pastures. In actual fact, the band have continued with the winning formula of the previous two offerings whilst throwing a few twists in to keep listeners hooked. Highlights include the Eastern-tinged deep inside, the gargantuan terrace-chants of (this is our) house and the show-stopping finale of stay with me but, as with the majority of In Flames albums, it is a record where different songs stand out depending upon when and how you listen to the record. In Flames continue to stand alone, pairing metallic riffs and melody with complete disdain for those who would rather see them pigeon-holed and compartmentalised. Their diversity is their strength and I, the mask is another triumph for the band. 8.5', '2018-12-13T17:32:52+00:00', '2', 'false', '3037', '594') ;

BUILD QUALITY
The keyboard is precision engineered, I didn"t find anything loose, keys out of place or even askew. It"s built solidly with care and precision. The keyboard weight is quite high and I find it difficult to re-orientate it using only my pinky fingers on either side while typing but this adds to its solid feeling construction.
The main typing chassis has very minor flex, considering how thin it is and that"s made from plastic I"m impressed. While typing there is no flexing at all, it just feels solid and sturdy.
THE TYPING EXPERIENCE
I purchased this keyboard because I really like chiclet style keyboards. If you"ve used an Apple laptop or desktop keyboard in the last 10 years it feels a lot like those but with a deeper actuation point so the keys can go down a little further. The important thing is, it feels great to type on. All the keys are consistent in the amount of force needed to actuate them with a satisfying key bounce.
The indentations on the key surfaces were something that concerned me before I received the keyboard as in the photos they look quite deep into the keys. But in reality it"s quite subtle and not easily visible from a sitting position, under the finger the indentations feel quite nice, almost like the keys conform to your finger tips. I would go so far as to say I prefer the indentation chiclet keys to the non-indentation type.
One thing this keyboard doesn"t suffer from is wobbly keys. I don"t know what mechanism Logitech is using but I"d assume it"s a two point scissor switch. You can press a key right on its very corner and it will still go down evenly, all the keys feel incredibly sturdy and solid. They also have almost no movement side to side which is nice.
Overall the typing experience is great, if you like chiclet style keyboards this is one of if not the best example of a chiclet implementation I"ve seen.
THE KEYBOARD BACK LIGHTING
One of the reasons I purchased this keyboard was because of the back lighting, not because I wanted the lighting but because it means the key letters are not printed so they cant rub off after a couple of years of use. The middle part of the keys I believe are laser etched and the lighting shines through very brightly.
You can control the intensity of the light and on the maximum brightness mode it is much brighter than other back light keyboards I"ve seen including Apples Retina MacBook Pro. There is a lot of back light bleed around the edges of the keys which I believe is due to them using a single light source for the entire keyboard to save battery but it still looks great with each key shining evenly and clearly.
The back lighting on the keyboard can be used while not plugged in and charging but it will automatically dim if your hands move away from the keyboard using some kind of proximity sensor. If you have it plugged in to charge you can keep the wireless lighting on permanently.
Personally I would have liked some control over how soon the lights dim when you stop typing as it feels a bit too soon for me. Also while the back light does slowly turn on and off it could be slowed further so it"s less noticeable when it occurs. At first I found the lighting turning off constantly to be distracting but I have since gotten used to it and no longer notice.
THE WIRELESS FEATURE
The wireless on the keyboard works solidly with both the included unifying receiver (USB Type A, very small receiver) and also with the built in Bluetooth. I"ve tried the keyboard with a PC using the unifying receiver and a Mac using Bluetooth and it works really well with both, I found no issues of any kind with the wireless signal it at no time lost connection to either machine while I used it.
The keyboard does feature a multi-connect system, there are three keys above insert, home and page up which enable you to instantly switch the keyboard between three devices. These can be Bluetooth devices like a Computer, Tablet or Smart Phone or devices using the unifying receiver. I found this feature not only works perfectly but is instantaneous.
THE BATTERY LIFE
Logitech states the battery lasts a week but I found this to be false. For me the battery lasts about 3 days with back lighting active. The good news is you can still use the keyboard while it"s plugged in and charging. The keyboard is supplied with a USB-A to USB-C cable with the USB-C side plugging into the keyboard for charging.
The battery life can be extended greatly if you choose to disable the lighting but it looks really great with the back lighting on and certainly easier to use with it turned on.
THE CREATIVE INPUT DIAL
Perhaps the first time a keyboard has come with a built in fidget device the wheel in the top left is supposed to be the keyboards stand out feature but I personally found its functionality to be quite basic and it feels like a novelty. I am a heavy Photoshop user and although it offers integration with Photoshop CC the things it enables you to do can be done quite quickly with the mouse or a pen input device like a Wacom tablet so its usefulness is suspect.
One area where I thought the input dial would shine is when changing the brush size dynamically while drawing a line in Photoshop but that"s not the case because you can only adjust the brush size with the dial when you"re not holding down your mouse cursor. This is a big disappointment for me. I"d gladly buy the keyboard at a lower price without the input dial entirely.
Another issue with the input dial is the noise it makes when changing modes. By default it will scroll without any resistance but when you activate a program profile that needs to provide "bumps" in the turning of the wheel, for example changing volume on a Mac or switching Tabs in Chrome it will make a very audible click sound as it engages some kind of gear inside the wheel. I found this to be quite annoying especially when you switch apps and you can hear it engaging and disengaging over and over each time you touch the wheel. Thankfully this "switching" functionality can be disabled but by doing so you"re losing a main feature point of the keyboard.
My last issue with the wheel is how easy it is to touch it by accident when reaching for the esc key in the top left corner. There is very little space between the wheel and the esc key and when you touch the wheel it brings up a volume adjustment screen on your display and it"s just annoying.
INCLUDED SOFTWARE
When I first plugged the unifying receiver into my PC (running Windows 10) it prompted me to download and install "LogiOptions" which appears to be the companion software for the keyboard from Logitech. This 149MB download allows you to customise the keyboards Input Dial on a per-application basis and also globally across all apps. It also allows you to customise the function keys along the top and a few other options such as permanently disabling the back light if desired. It also shows the battery life and the status of your unifying wireless adaptor if you use it.
I believe this software also enables the third party integration between the input dial and apps like Photoshop. It can bring up overlays on the screen when you touch the input dial to indicate what tool you"re adjusting by tapping, clicking or turning the dial. The interface is very clean and professional looking in-keeping with Windows 10 style cues.
I found the software to be quite stable and easy to use, it does include an automatic updater built in which I also found easy to use with a minimal amount of effort needed to install new updates when presented to me by the interface.
PRICE
I feel the keyboard at £159.99 which is what I paid for it from Amazon is still asking a lot. The typing experience is stellar, the brightness of the back light is great. The wireless feature with the ability to still use the keyboard even while being charged is a nice touch and the included USB-C charging cable is good to see on a 2017 product but I feel it would be much more appropriately priced at £99.99.
CONCLUSION
I really like the keyboard for typing, I"d much rather buy a version without the click wheel for less money and I"d like to see them increase the battery capacity so you don"t need to charge it as often.
Positives:
 + Great typing experience
 + Really bright back lighting
 + Great keycaps that feel stable and enjoyable to press
 + Good well thought out key layout
 + Perfect choice and placement of all function/media keys along the top row
Cons:
 - Lack of control over back light proximity timeout
 - Creative Input Dial is mostly an expensive gimmick
 - Creative Input Dial is placed a bit too close to the esc key causing unintended dial touches
 - Battery life could be a lot better
 - Price: About 37% more than it should be.', '2019-01-28T17:32:52+00:00', '0', 'false', '3261', '550') ;

I have done my research, and many have complained about this but Logitech are staying mute on the issue so I don"t foresee this being resolved anytime soon, if ever. It"s a  real pain if you have a tablet as I do and only one USB port. Typing experience is quite nice however, and the keyboard itself does look very good, so keeping it despites the flaws.', '2018-09-02T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '3261', '602') ;

That said, although this is a keyboard you"re not here to read about how it types are you? You want to know about the crown functionality! So let"s leave that part for other reviewers to deal with and dive into how the crown has come into use in my day to day design life.
From a technical standpoint the crown is pretty spectacular. The lightest of touches brings up the control menu, the way it satisfyingly clicks between free spin and ratcheted spin both sounds, and more importantly, feels sublime and it looks gorgeous too. Although, when I say the lightest of touches I really do mean the lightest of touches, it feels like even looking at the crown triggers the menu popping up, so expect to see it a few hundred times a day. Fortunately it"s harder to actually accidentally trigger a change than it is to bring up the menu, so although you"ll be spawning the menu accidentally you won"t be randomly adjusting the brightness too often (but it WILL happen, probably when the CEO is at your desk).
Now, when I was reading about this keyboard before purchasing I fantasised about how much time i would save with the crown, how it would revolutionise my workflow and would make me the world"s greatest designer in a matter of seconds. The sad reality is that although I used it a fair bit the first week, by the end of the first month I was baring using it at all. I guess I"m just too accustomed to keyboard shortcuts and end up going into autopilot. I do still use it for some things, mainly skipping songs and changing the volume of music (there are volume and skip keys on the keyboard, but I gotta get use out of this crown some how!).
So it"s not the design revolution I was hoping for, but it is a really cool bit of kit. If you forced yourself to use the crown and stuck with it then you probably could end up streamlining your workflow. But if you"ve been designing for years you"ll probably only end up using the crown for a minimal amount of uses.
So why haven"t I returned this keyboard? Because of that thing we don"t really want to talk about - it"s such a lovely typing experience. The key travel is perfect, as is the spacing and the click as you strike each key. It"s truly a joy to type with.
Also I"ll just touch on battery life because I"ve seen some conflicting reviews on this. I have the backlight turned off and go weeks and weeks without needing to charge the keyboard, so unless you"re working in a cave you should just turn the backlight off and bask in the joy of forgetting where you left the charging lead.', '2018-05-05T17:32:52+01:00', '2', 'false', '3261', '465') ;

Maybe it"s one off but here are the problems with mine:
- works great when on wireless only yet the battery last for no time at all
- when connected to charge via USB C (as well as wireless dongle connected) the keyboard is playing around constantly. It will start flashing lights like there is low battery and randomly some keys will stop responding, then after 30sec no keys respond at all until slide the switch to off and on again or unplug USB C which renders the keyboard useless.
- sometimes whatever options you set in software gets ingored (for example if you watch the movie and you set your keyboard to volume up) when you turn the nob it will start spotify and play that instead of film. Restart Logitech software and it somehow works until next time you are trying to switch windows and it will randomly play music Full volume.
Such expensive keyboard - great design and feel very premium yet for me it"s very dissapointing for company like Logitech which I"m forever fan as their tech just works - so not sure if this is random keyboard or others do have the same issue.

One keyboard and mouse, one set of screens, two computers. This keyboard seemed to be a perfect bridge for my setup.
There are of course other features such as the scroll wheel, build quality and how the keys feel, but the ability to easily switch was my primary reason for buying it.
Scroll Wheel
This is fun, but in reality, your muscle memory for doing the same thing with keyboard shortcuts means you sort of have to remember to use it and I found I forgot to use it.
Key travel
Typing was actually rather good, I am used to the shallower keys of the Apple keyboards, but this worked well I found. There are bumps for your fingers to fall into as you type and if I am honest I wasn"t mad about this, I prefer flatter keys and when I timed myself I found that I was actually slower with this keyboard than when I used a Mac keyboard.
Build
The keyboard weighs quite a bit so it doesn"t slip around on the desk which is nice. It feels really well made and like it would last well. The keys light up which is really nice and the motion sensor is a nice touch, but you need to turn that off if you want to use the keyboard wirelessly. You can of course have it constantly charging but that rather defeats the purpose. Plus you can"t replace the batteries so I imagine constantly charging it would end the life of the device sooner than expected. D"Oh!
Bluetooth
This is where things really start to fall down. At set up I added my two computers and all was good. I even added my iPad pro for fun and that worked well too. But as the computers went to sleep the bluetooth connectivity would drop and then when it came to use one of the computers, I found the keyboard wasn"t connected so I couldn"t type in the password to unlock it meaning I had to get out the wired keyboard, type in the password, re-connect the Logitech keyboard and then start over, connect the device and type in a six digit code - EVERY TIME! Sometimes it would drop and then not see the device as I think the bluetooth device key is cached and the computer thinks it is already connected. So you go round in circles trying to get the thing working whilst not actually doing any work!
That game got dull very quickly so I tried to get in touch with Logitech support, who never replied (still haven"t 5 weeks later). I spoke to Apple support (thinking this might be a software issue) who were great, but couldn"t solve it for me. I even formatted my machine to exclude it being a corrupted bluetooth preference file or similar. I looked online for more info and eventually found a forum which was comprised of OSX and Windows people bemoaning this very issue and also Logitech support for being non existent.
So I sent the keyboard back (Amazon being great as ever) and ordered the Apple Magic keyboard which is very nice. It doesn"t have the switch options, but I"m learning that no keyboard really can, at least not now.
If you are trying to solve the same thing as me, I am now using a KVM (Keyboard, Video Monitor) switch, software that Logitech were basically trying to use via their Options product, but synced to buttons on the keyboard. The product I am using is called Synergy. This does the job I was after. It"s not perfect, but better than not working at all which is what you get with this Logitech keyboard.', '2018-11-22T17:32:52+00:00', '2', 'false', '3261', '355') ;

Am posting this hoping I"ll get some help from fellow Mid 2015 15" MacBook Pro users. First of all, I go through keyboards like crazy, never finding one I like, but this pretty much is I think "the one", blending the all important typing experience with great back lighting and all round versatility. Am using it to "drive" my Note8 (friends who think they can type quickly on their iPhones now have an adversary, mwah ha ha!), a Google Pixelbook and aforementioned MacBook. However, after my MacBook has been asleep for longer than a certain time (not sure how long it needs to be yet), when I wake it up with my corded mouse, the Craft refuses to connect, and I have to login using the Macbook keyboard. (I have it covered.) I am convinced this an Apple issue, not Logitech, else my other devices would not connect after being off or asleep. Once I login on the Macbook using it"s own keyboard, most of the time, it re-connects, but sometimes I have to unpair and re-pair.
Anyone else with a Mid 2015 MacBook Pro 15" with latest version of Mac OS having this issue or am I 1 in 6 billion? :P

The partner software, Logitech Options, is abysmal and lacks any basic features. Using the "crown" causes an obnoxious popup to appear on your screen telling you what you"re using; there is no way to disable this. The Crown itself is pretty interesting, it has potential to increase workflow, however it is incredibly limited in what it can do, and most of its functionality is not customisable and only works in very specific programs, sometimes when you don"t want it to.
Logitech Options really is the bane of this product. It allows customisation of very, very few keys, and if you happen to use both an options enabled mouse and keyboard, your Fn button causes your mouse to become unresponsive while held even when the feature (whose name I forget) is disabled. I would recommend not installing it all if that were an option.
As far as membrane keyboards go, it"s lovely to type on. The keys are bouncy and sturdy, and although I would have liked a teensy bit more feedback, I felt bad returning this product when it was such a nice typing experience. The entire keyboard is very, very sturdy and feels great to move around. Battery performance leaves a lot to be desired, however, as the thing will last anywhere between 20-10 hours once disconnected depending on usage and brightness. Not a problem for me personally, but if you"re used to more basic keyboards you might also be used to them lasting several months on once charge.
At the end of the week, I had to return this. £140 was far too much to ask for a keyboard with so many flaws. I might be willing to pay £80 for a version without the silly crown, as this is a very satisfying keyboard to just use as a basic, featureless bluetooth keyboard around the office.

I also bought the MX-Ergo trackball but more on that later.
My initial thoughts are that it"s well made and feels sturdy, it"s nice and heavy. The backlight is nice but I don"t use it.
The dial is a bit of a pain. It has a free running smooth turn mode and a click mode which is contextual. It changes from click to smooth depending on what application you have open and what the dial"s function is. There is a small mechanism inside the keyboard that changes this mode and you can hear it clicking inside the keyboard.
There is a new logitech program called options which allows you to change the function of the dial for a generic mode and one for each application. I set them all to volume up/down and push for mute.
This has caused me a problem though, the dial still seems to randomly change from smooth to click mode and when it does that the volume jumps up and down by increments of 15 instead of increments of 1.
I"ve logged a case with logi and they went through some troubleshooting but to no avail. Apparently they are replacing it as mechanical failure but that was over a week ago they said this and nothing has happened since then.
Another slightly annoying feature is that this keyboard is rechargeable and it uses USB-C to connect to a charger. That in itself is no problem. However,  I also bought the MX Ergo trackball when I bought this and that uses micro USB.

I also use two computers over a KVM, so I couldn"t use that keyboard.  I needed something that was close to that, but with a standard USB dongle.  This seems to be the best bet.  I don"t mind paying for quality.
The keys are a cut above normal chiclet keys, but not as good as the Surface.  What is incredibly annoying is the dual PC / Macintosh key legends.  I thought I wouldn"t mind.  I touch type, and though that it wouldn"t matter.  It does.  Those visual clues you use to position your hands just disappear, the times you"re going for an unusual character, it"s a mess.  Do I want the " character above the right hand shift key, or next to the left?  If I want ~ , I have a choice of two - one next to enter and the other next to left shift.  They standardise the keycaps to Macintosh to the left and PC to the right, but you don"t want to think when you"re typing - you want to just instantly react to a cue.  It"s frustrating when you find the wrong one.  The keyboard fails abysmally at this.  It also looks appalling.  My surface keyboard is clean and uncluttered.  My understanding of Apple users is that they appreciate design as well.  I"d be surprised if an Apple fan were happy with this design.  The only acceptable use of this would be for somebody using it for two computers (as I am), but with one of each flavour.  Or of course, to cost cut your keyboard and reduce SKUs in inventory, which is, of course, the real reason.
I"m out of my 30 days now, so some judicious permanent marker use and it"s now more dedicated to PC.  It looks scruffy, but a lot less cluttered and confusing.
The dial is ok, but not a patch on the surface dial.  I use the logitech dial as a volume control and my surface dial for its well integrated functionality (and the neat on-screen stuff).  It"s useful as a volume control, but it doesn"t affect my productivity.  There"s nothing it can do that can"t be better done by another mouse wheel.
In summary, had I paid £70 for this, I"d have put up with the compromises, but at this price I shouldn"t have to.  I"m continuing with it, but I"ll be keeping my eye out for some sort of Bluetooth Rx -> USB Keyboard emulator so that I can go back to my Surface keyboard.
Battery life is a week at best with dim infrequent backlight use.  I hate to do this comparison again, but my Surface keyboard lasts months (no backlight, though).  Major plus point for using USB Type-C, though.  I can"t wait to bin my micro USB leads.  Why did it take so long to get reversible connectors?
If you use just Macs, or Just PCs, do yourself a favour and get the Apple or Microsoft keyboard.  If you"re KVMing between both then this is perfect.', '2018-10-23T17:32:52+01:00', '2', 'false', '3261', '100') ;

Here"s a track by track:
1. Nineties
A new sound that brings the guitars back with a BANG! The song starts with a Night Driver-esqe first verse and them BAM, the biggest guitar riff ever on a Busted record kicks in with Charlie Simpson belting out emotionally charged vocals. The lyrics are silly for sure, but the amount of conviction and emotion Matt, James and Charlie sing them with actually gives me the chills, the amount of emotion they"ve put into this song shows the passion for the band is bigger than ever before, one of the best Busted songs of all time!
2. Reunion
STRAIGHT OUT OF 2002! If someone told me that this was an unreleased song from the debut album sessions back in 2002 then I"d believe them because it re-captures their debut album and b-sides sound PERFECTLY! The lyrics cleverly tie in a love song while also talking about Busted themselves AND IT"S GREAT, Busted are BACK back!
3. What Happened To Your Band
The best Son Of Dork song. The best McBusted song. ONE OF the best Busted songs which really shows how great this band"s output is when a song THIS GREAT is only ONE OF their best songs! I was only disappointed by the fact that instead of dropping the F bomb Matt instead says "they mess with my mind and make me miserable" so for that alone I prefer the McBusted version, but this is a great version. When I saw the tracklist I was a bit gutted that we were getting a song that has already been released, but end of the day this is one of the greatest songs James Bourne has ever written and you could put it on ANY album and it"d make the album even better,  Sgt Pepper"s Lonely Hearts Club Band and Nevermind could benefit from this song so it"s a very welcome addition to Halfway There and I get the chills everytime!
4. Shipwrecked In Atlantis
Back to back the 2 best songs on the album, What Happened To Your Band into Shipwrecked In Atlantis is one of the best one-two punches I"ve heard on ANY album ever! This song is pure pop-punk and has great riffs and melodies, it gets better by the listen and is easily and instantly one of my favourite Busted songs of all time! Like Nineties, despite the silly lyrics the conviction and emotion is there and you get the chills from just how great the vocal delivery is! Amazing song, my favourite on the album!
5. Race To Mars
I"m going to get negative here and admit that I"m not fussed.  It"s a new sound and the chorus has its moments, but after the 5 star, A+ quality of the first 4 songs this one takes the songwriting quality down a bit, I"m just not feeling it lyrically, vocally or musically. I respect them for trying new things though and not keeping things strictly 2002, every artist needs to experiment!
6. All My Friends
STRAIGHT OUT OF 2002! Like Reunion, this song is straight up old school Busted, sounds like an unreleased song from the debut album sessions! Lyrically it"s great, the melody is great, it"s Meet You There for 2019 and I love it! Lyrically it reminds me of The Kids Aren"t Alright by The Offspring, telling stories about people they once knew and Busted have executed this topic brilliantly!
7. MIA
The other song I"m not fussed on, it gives me vibes of an McFly - Above The Noise  album track. It just doesn"t blow my mind like almost every other song on the album! The music and the melodies just don"t do it for me (especially not the "you"re always MIA-a-a-a-a-a-a") and the song doesn"t give me any chills, the lyrics are the best part though. The bar was set too high and this doesn"t reach it, my least favourite song on the album.
7. Radio
THIS is doing a new sound right! It sounds like Stereophonics recorded a song and Kelly Jones was sick on the day so he called up Matt, James and Charlie to sing it and called Noel Gallagher in to play the guitar solo! BRILLIANT song, one of the best Busted have ever done and it"s only my 4th favourite on the album which says a lot about the quality of the other songs! A great single choice and a breath of fresh air for the band!
9. Nostalgia
It"s pop-punk, but it"s a new ground of pop-punk for Busted! The quiet verses into the big chorus, I"m not sure what it reminds me of, but it"s a fresh Busted sound and I really like it! This is the song I have the least to say about, but the point is I like it, especially the verses, more fast pop-punk is always welcome with Busted!
10. It Happens
STRAIGHT OUT OF 2002 again! Another that sounds like an unreleased song from the debut album sessions! It tells the story of Busted from their own perspectives and is an epic album closer, somewhat sad, somewhat uplifting, it"s an emotional rollercoaster! A very triumphant song!
Overall, this album feels like the missing link between Busted and A Present For Everyone. It"s very self-aware of how the public think Busted should sound and borders on self parody sometimes, but the guitars are back, the songs are great and most importantly it"s FUN which is what made Busted so huge in the first place!
I rate this album 4/5 stars just because there"s 2 songs I don"t like, but the great songs are GREAT! Some of their best songs ever, but to me their best work is the 10 non-single album tracks on A Present For Everyone which are a very high bar and just great great songs without being self-aware of being Busted or not being Busted, whereas Halfway there is a very self-aware Busted sound!
Halfway There is the 2nd best album Busted have made and as they"ve gone in the right direction by bringing the guitars back things will only get better! Almost like they planned it!', '2018-06-16T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '3283', '196') ;

with a weird girl/woman obsessed fanbase they can ruin an actual opinion and just praise praise praise a poor album.
For me I am a 29 year old man, I was a teenager when Busted were popular and I did like them but always found them a bit naff to say you liked them.
They went away and that was it until MCBUSTED. That album
was excellent, really good combination of two groups revealing some top quality music writing.
Then Charlie rejoined.
NIGHTDRIVER is an excellent album. It was so different to old Busted songs which is what made it appealing.
Now this album, to me, is a step backwards. it’s like they got too scared to try new things and went with what is easy. What you end up with is pop musics with no substance.
The only songs on the album that are worth listening to unless you are a 25 year old woman ( which is their mass audience now) are the following
- RADIO 8/10
- MIA 7/10
- NINETIES 7/10
- REUNION - 7/10
- ALL MY FRIENDS - 5/10
The rest are pretty poor, you’re welcome to your opinion but they just lack anything.
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR BAND is not included as is a cover of a 4 year old MCBUSTED song and is a poor cover really and not as good.
Ultimately you are left with a poor effort to make an album. What they needed to do is build on NIGHT DRIVER and move forward.
I see this is as album 3 and then Charlie left as he thought the music was rubbish.
3/5 stars is fair. 50% of the tracks are not good.
I can see them pushing out another album of this type of music before they quit again. Sadly they will never be popular and never reach number 1 in any chart. They lack mass appeal.

This album is everything every original fan has hoped for. It has the same punk-pop like feel to it as some of the older tracks in the first two albums, but with a more grown up feel. A different road to their previous album Night Driver. But Half Way There is exceptional on all levels. Charlie, Matt and James have done extremely well with this, working with the amazing Gil Norton, Chris Bourne and Cobus. The lyrics, vocals, the backing tracks and just the production and way the whole record has been put together is absolutely fantastic. Couldn"t have asked for better.

In fact, "Reunion"  sounds so similar to the pop-punk  band who first hit the charts in 2002 that you might well mistake it for an unreleased track off their debut album.
Of course, the band have matured musically as in well as age and as such this is an album which will appeal more to the adults than the teens. There are real standout tracks including the nostalgic opening song "Nineties", "Shipwrecked in Atlantis" which serves as another nod to the sound of their heyday, the acoustic rocker "All My Friends" which has the makings of a real indie anthem along with the edgy "Radio" which might surprise those still sceptical as to how far they"ve come and how credible these men now are. Not all of the other songs on the record are as memorable, a few just don"t stand out to me, but I can safely say that there is more good than bad here.

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('9248', 'I was after a Trust mouse as it offers a 2 year warranty and my previous wireless mouse died after ... 23 months!
Make no mistake, this is one cheap looking and cheap feeling mouse with thin plastics but it does everything that it says on the tin. Despite the overly fussy design, it handles well and is comfortable for several hours use. The buttons are nice and clicky and the sides have pimpled rubberised panels for extra grip. There"s an additional DPI button to change the sensitivity and tracking but this is a soft touch button and I"ve only used it a few times (made little to no difference).
What"s much better is the scrolling wheel which is both ratcheted and etched so your finger won"t slip. You can also click it for a middle button action. Underneath the Trust Ziva, there is a tiny on / off switch which needs a fingernail to operate, and a battery compartment with space to stow the wireless receiver so you won"t lose it. There are several nifty auto-off features which work very well; after several minutes of inactivity, the mouse will go into sleep mode and can be woken up with a click; disconnecting the wireless receiver also puts the mouse to sleep; and for good measure you can always turn it off manually using the switch. With daily use, the batteries have lasted just under 3 months which is poor compared to other mice that advertise anything up to 18 months of battery life, but then again, it"s only a fiver to begin with. It might also just be the batteries that came with the mouse were not fully charged.
Using the Trust Ziva is great, I"ve not had any dropouts or erratic cursors like with other wireless mouses (mice? meeses?) and the tracking is nice and smooth with accuracy when you need it coupled with sufficient ergonomics and a nicely sculpted design to minimise fatigue.
What"s not so good however is the battery compartment of the Trust Ziva. It"s so flimsy and cheap that you"re scared to even sneeze in case the battery door falls off. If you end up dropping your mouse, I wouldn"t expect it to survive a drop of more than 30cm. Added to that is the stupid way in which the batteries have been arranged so they are stacked on top of one another. The top battery has a large gap to one side and is only held in place by the battery compartment lid so when you take this off, there"s a 50% chance the top battery will slip out of position as there"s nothing there to hold it in.
I also don"t like the side buttons to move backwards and forwards whilst browsing so it"s a shame these can"t be disabled. Other than Gamers, I don"t actually know anyone who uses more than the standard 2 buttons and scroll wheel of a mouse and accidently hitting these when browsing can be  pain.
To summarise then, this compact mouse looks and feels like a fiver but does everything advertised with a few extra features like the auto power off. The 2 year warranty from a company that won"t disappear overnight is a bonus. It comes retail packed with batteries and for a fiver is a bargain.', '2018-07-20T17:32:52+01:00', '0', 'false', '3315', '203') ;

I have always purchased reconditioned pc"s, mostly because i am tight but i think any laptop from new become old stock in a month when the new model arrives. so why pay loads for a laptop? old story you pay for what you get and refurbished you get lots for your money.
.good computer still made by Lenovo great for work or using as a true mobile laptop, unlike some laptops that look nice but arnt made with this pc"s chassis.
conclusion

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('9348', 'The new Avantasia album is an entertaining release with some solid songs but it unfortunately ends up being one of the weakest albums in the project"s discography. While there is plenty of variety covering symphonic rock, pop rock, power metal, heavy metal, AOR and ballads, the songwriting is not as captivating as it was in the past.
The instrumental portion of the album is handled as usual by Tobias Sammet on bass and lead vocals, Sascha Paeth (ex-Heaven"s Gate) on guitars, Felix Bohnke (Edguy) on drums and Michael Rodenberg responsible for the orchestrations. The list of guest vocalists includes Hansi Kürsch (Blind Guardian), Jorn Lande (ex-Ark, ex-Masterplan), Ronnie Atkins (Pretty Maids), Michael Kiske (Helloween, Unisonic), Geoff Tate (ex-Queensryche), Bob Catley (Magnum), Candice Night (Blackmore"s Night), Mille Petrozza (Kreator) and Eric Martin (Mr. Big).
“Book of Shallows” is the heaviest song on offer and one of the best ones as well. It is fast paced and includes some powerful and heavy guitar riffs, a catchy chorus and nice vocal transitions between Hansi Kürsch, Ronnie Atkins, Jorn Lande and Mille Petrozza.
“Alchemy” probably contains the best chorus on the album and is another highlight. It is an atmospheric mid tempo melodic metal song with a darker atmosphere and some welcome heavier riffs. Geoff Tate blends well with Tobias Sammet and offers some nice vocal work that harkens back to Queensryche.
“Requiem for a Dream” is a fast power metal song with a soaring chorus and a major highlight. This is the only song to feature Michael Kiske on vocals and as usual he provides a stunning performance showing off his power and upper range. Although it is a signature Avantasia song it just works great and provides a twist with its atmospheric church chant intro and the inclusion of a bass solo.
“The Piper at the Gates of Dawn” is not perfect but generally works well and is another standout song. It is one of the longest tracks and the only to feature that many singers sharing vocals. The song includes some irritating modern keyboards and its chorus is similar to the Avantasia song Another Angel Down, but it is bombastic, catchy and features one of the best guitar solos on the album. In addition, guest vocalists Atkins, Lande, Martin, Catley and Tate do an admirable job and make the track a little more memorable.
Moonglow’s biggest flaw is the absence of catchy choruses on several tracks and the feeling of déjà vu in several song passages. The epic “The Raven Child” is the perfect example as it includes a Blind Guardian inspired intro, Iron Maiden and Savatage influences, an ending section that is identical to the Avantasia song The Scarecrow and a rather unmemorable chorus. Despite some great vocal work by Jorn Lande the whole thing ends up sounding unoriginal, boring and long. Another drawback is the general absence of guitar solos in the album. The last negative aspect of Moonglow is the fact that Tobias Sammet sings on all songs and doesn’t leave much room for the guest vocalists to fully unveil their talents.
Moonglow is definitely weaker when compared to the previous album Ghostlights. It is not a bad album as it is inspired, bombastic and offers some memorable moments, but it is not great either. It will probably sound good and interesting for someone not familiar with Avantasia, but for older fans it has unfortunately little to offer.', '2018-10-25T17:32:52+01:00', '0', 'false', '3426', '666') ;

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('9358', 'Richard Thompson"s last album, Still, was apparently his first top ten hit, which initially struck me as a bit undeserved, not because he personally doesn"t deserve it - he clearly does, he"s Richard Thompson - but because Still will probably go down as one of the least inspired Thompson albums: he could do stuff like She Never Could Resist A Winding Road while you were lobbing hand grenades at him, or heavier artillery fire even.
But I don"t suppose he can help what the media says or promotes, or really cares about it, and the good news is that 13 Rivers is a much more deserving album of such acclaim in the pretty well unsurpassed Thompson catalogue anyway. I mean, even legends like Neil Young are struggling to come up with albums to match their legacy or that break new ground these days. In fact, I can only think of Sparks, of a similar vintage, who continue to make such exciting new sounds.
But Thompson does manage it here, with an album that is up there with Daring Adventures, Across A Crowded Room, The Old Kit Bag and even his classics with Linda Thompson - that is, it"s among his very best. But it"s not really like anything he"s done before either. For a start, it"s sharp as a tack. Perhaps the sparsity of arrangement and darkness is most like Across A Crowded Room, but it has a murky depth that that album doesn"t possess, courtesy of the two other guys in the band - the "rhythm section". Thompson"s guitar dominates this album, which is not really surprising given that it is a three piece, but is there another guitarist who can create so much variety and colour within such a traditional set up? No.
The songs are excellent too, the murkier the better: Her Love Was Meant For Me, The Rattle Within, The Bones Of Gilead, Shaking The Gates, The Storm Won"t Come and another four or five blistering tracks could be in his set list for the rest of his life. They"re almost in the same ballpark as PJ Harvey"s Let England Shake album, but with more folky melodicism and even more bite. Going by this album, Richard Thompson could be PJ"s son!
Which just leaves the final part of the Richard Thompson three-headed genius, the poet. I always think Thompson never sounds dated because he is generally considerably pissed off, which for some reason doesn"t go out of style, like, say, the kitsch positivity of so many stars who have come and gone since his Fairport Convention days. But he"s pissed off with such good humour you can only marvel at the fact he"s coming up with this music in his idyllic sunny Los Angeles home and not some windswept, run-down coastal town in Wales - no disrespect to Wales - where it barely stops raining and is populated by people who do not necessarily have your best intentions at heart. Having said that, it"s all actually quite uplifting and I would imagine you"ll enjoy it a great deal. It would even make a nice Christmas present, though perhaps most appropriately for your more Dickensian friends.', '2018-08-23T17:32:52+01:00', '2', 'false', '3431', '653') ;

Currently I am studying for upcoming exams and I use two chrome tabs simultaneously (one for research and the other for google docs to type up study notes). I find that the chromebit can handle this easily. I have a logitech wireless USB keyboard and mouse which work fine with the device. Overall I am pleased with the chromebit given that it is silent, starts up instantly, takes up no space and undertakes basic tasks with ease.
However I have noticed some drawbacks. This is related to the processing power of the device. Certain websites which contain a lot of data/photos (such as engadget.com) take a longer time to load and are often glitchy. Furthermore if I open an additional streaming tab (such as spotify) then overall performance suffers considerably. Youtube videos at 1080p are also painful to watch although due to reduced FPS although I"ll admit I havent yet tried netflix.
If Asus released an updated version with more RAM and a more powerful processor which was more capable of multitasking and high resolution video streaming then I feel they would be onto a real desktop killer. Why spend any more on a PC or iMac if all you need is internet access and a word processor?

I play with an Audio Technica LP120 on a pair of JBL LSR305’s and whilst it’s not perfect the audio is definitely high enough quality for me to be able to enjoy.
The box set itself is beautiful, really nice attention to detail as you can see in the images linked to this review. The vinyls are well packed, individually sleeved then all come together in a bigger cardboard sleeve.
My only issue with the vinyl is it’s all boxed up nicely, but there’s a small glossy paper wrap around with the age rating on in a rainbow colour, this doesn’t attach to the rest of the package so if you want to keep everything together you end up with a loose piece of paper. This piece serves no purpose but I like to keep everything the vinyl comes with, including the hype stickers on the front, so for me that’s a drawback but I imagine most people will just throw this away.
Item arrived undamaged and I imagine this is a vinyl that will only increase in value as time goes on.

I was hesitant to pull the trigger on these at first , because they are 250 ohms and it"s generally required to use an amp with these ( which i don"t have yet). However , even plugged straight into my Macbook Pro they sound amazing.
I have a pair of AKG K550s and even though those are lovely headphones , ever since i got these the AKGs are gathering dust. These Beyers have a much better overall sound than the AKGs and the sound stage is just amazing ( i think due to the nature of the open-back design).
Now one minor gripe i have with these is that the headphones are made out of plastic and not aluminium , but they"re incredibly well-built. And being made of plastic, they are quite light and therefore - very comfortable to wear over extended periods of time.
Considering the price and the fact that these are Made In Germany , this is an incredible deal in my book. If you are on the hunt for a pair of open-back headphones , definitely give these a shot.', '2018-09-03T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '3639', '568') ;

I spent a good few months looking into AMP""s/DACs and different brands but didn"t want to completely empty bank account.
I decided on these highly reviewed DT990 250ohm, paired with a FiiO E10K Olympus USB DAC, and the sound is AMAZING.
After reading forum posts and reviews i thought the lack of bass people spoke about would be a bit disappointing but i would use the bass boost option on the DAC to make up for it. But i didn"t need too, the bass is really punchy without the boost, and in my opinion for whatever its worth, its the absolute perfect amount.
The build quality is really nice although the outside of the ear cups are plastic, they still look smart and feel really sturdy.
They are also incredibly light and comfortable, I"ve recently used them for 8"ish hours straight playing games and they felt comfortable the entire time. No sweaty ears or uncomfortable pressure around my ears.
For anyone considering these for PC Gaming, i absolutely recommend getting them, especially with the FiiO E10K DAC. The positional sound is BRILLIANT. I"ve used Plantronic 780 7.1"s,Tritton AX and Kama, Turtle Beach pros,  Razer Kraken 7.1, Corsair HS40 7.1 and Sennheiser PC 350SE but the sound quality and directional sound of these DT990"s is massively above all of them. When playing with friends who use similar headphones to what i used to use, i now hear things and can pin point the direction of sounds easier and clearer than they do, whether it be nearby footsteps or distant gunfire. I was even accused of ""wall hacking"" yesterday because i could hear other players around walls and corners so clearly and pre-fired.
Highly recommend to anyone looking to really up the audio quality of their music or gaming experience. After years of cheap to expensive ""Gaming Headsets"" i wish i had bought a DAC and decent Audiophile headphones sooner.

Short review line is, these are excellent. Job done, you can go now.
Not satisfied? Well I"ve tested them out against my 5.1 Logitech z906 speakers which are running on an optical connection (worth noting that the DT990s are running from a Creative Labs G5 dac). In games the bass on the headphones is incredible. Cannon fire in World of Warships woke me up and not because it was loud but just because I"d never heard such a boom before. I"ve also been testing this on music (not an audiophile so bear with me here) and having just ran Masterchef Synesthesiaby by Swede Mason through both, one after the other, the sound was distinctive. I get why people say these cans aren"t for bass heads after this test, not that it"s from a lack of bass on the cans but because it"s airy. The speakers delivered a wall of sound which I felt as much as heard and the result was the bass was powerful but messy. I couldn"t tell one bass line from another. With the DT990s I can tell which bass line is doing what without any effort whatsoever but it doesn"t assault my head with a rumble designed to make soup of my brain (that"s both an advantage and a disadvantage in my book). I can say however that the bass isn"t lacking. Spread Your Love doesn"t have quite the dirty bass I"m used to. Keine Lust comes through nice and punchy (as I"ve just found out, ensure you have that dac set to direct audio or you"re wasting the potential of these cans) but unlike most headphones, iems and speakers I"ve tried this track on, I can separate the guitars perfectly, even in the busy chorus.
Now, for build quality, these feel excellent. I"ve broken many headsets in my time and the only ones to last have been a pair of Sennheiser PC323Ds which these DT990s are replacing. I"ve got confidence that these cans will last a good long while. They"re solid and feel like they"re going to be heavy but really aren"t when they"re on your head. As for fit, I have an inordinately large cranium (stop giggling!) and they fit fine. Firm clamping force fresh out of the box. Nothing uncomfortable. Does feel a little warm around my head but I"m more of a cold weather guy and it"s been up to 26c in front of my pc the last couple of nights so I"m putting it down to that.
Accessories wise, you get the necessary and no more. The jack adaptor seems robust and well made (the threads on the screw joint into the 3.5mm work fine, which is usually the test of a decent engineer), the bag is nothing special and there"s nothing else in the box.
If you like rock music from System of a Down to AC/DC and Queen Adreena, I"d say you can buy with confidence.
As a parting note, I"m listening to Midlife Crysis by Faith no More as I write this and not only am I finding new pieces of the music that I can enjoy, the bass is there like I"ve never heard before. It"s no longer a background of continual growl without much rhythm but specific notes!
I am very impressed with these cans (as you can probably tell). Now all I"m left wondering at is what you"d get for the £2k cans and above? If this is the lower end of the range then call me a philistine and leave me happy here.', '2018-07-16T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '3639', '140') ;

I game a lot...)
I had done my research and had settled on these DT990s due to reputable brand, price, reviews etc but was still worried about how much noise the open back would let in while gaming. I knew the sound stage was much larger and would hopefully give me a bit of an advantage in games, but I worried the outside noise like cars and planes would void that - I was thankfully wrong. The open back doesn"t let in nearly as much noise as I thought it would, but it"s just enough to stop me from shouting (I used to shout a lot because I couldn"t hear myself while wearing my old 
 )
The only issue I had with these was how tight they sat on my head. I have a tiny head and the clamped really hard above my ears and caused a bit of pain. It took quite a bit of use for them to finally loosen up and now I don"t have any pain or clamping - don"t remember how long it took for them to settle and form to my head though.

For reference my current setup is running the headphones through the headphone amp on my Soundblaster ZxR. I have a pair of AKG K550 which are good quality but very flat. I also own a couple of pairs of Sennheiser headsets: The 360 and the game one, both have pretty good sound quality but are still a bit flat, although not nearly as much as the AKG K550. All 3 sets pale in comparison to the Beyer 990s for films, music and games.
The bass and treble are both excellently reproduced with these headphones. If you are watching a film you might find yourself looking around the room when a truck goes past as the depth of the bass is so good, but not at all overpowering. Likewise the treble is very snappy and harsh sounds like bullets snapping by soldiers and tires screeching sound as unpleasant as they would in the flesh.
It"s also quite impressive how they will pick out a lof of the ambient noises in TV and film so you can hear bits of background conversations that would normally just sound like noise.
In terms of music genres I listen to rock, metal, hip hop, drum and bass and most likely a few genres I can"t think of right now. The Beyers work well in all of them and I"m genuinely surprised at being able to hear so much additional detail when none of my previous headphones/headsets were exactly cheap or bad. It"s worth noting that these headphones are not overly bassy like some other headphones I can think of that are apparently popular because an artist put his name on them and added some metal weights so they feel "expensive"
Sadly the headband is made of either real or fake leather that bunches ever so slightly due to the bend of the headband and digs into your head. I don"t know why Beyer didn"t use the microfibre type material the ear cups are made of as that"s really comfortable and works very well on other sets of headphones I own.
I"m currently looking at making my own head band strip as the current one starts to become quite unpleasant after a couple of hours of wear. I"d say it is really inexcusable for headphones costing this much to have such a band headband and if the sound quality wasn"t so impressive I would have sent them back.
It"s also worth noting that the headband suffers from falling apart from moisture after a year or so, it"s discussed a lot online and would explain why a replacement is so readily available.

The top end is really crisp, best appreciated when listening to acoustic tracks: the pluck of every guitar string is placed delightfully right into the centre of your head. This combination of a crisp top and a detailed, unoffensive bass gives the cans a wide, "analytical" sound that is energetic and enjoyable in its own right. However, the middle is somewhat lacking and (if you have an amp) you may find yourself cranking up the volume to interrogate subtleties in the body of the sound. You can keep climbing the dB and these headphones will give you more and more, but you may end up confronting eardrum-piercing high frequencies before you get to the meaty middle that you so desire, depending on your taste. If you"re looking for analytical phones in terms of a flatter, more faithful frequency response curve, these aren"t perfect out-of-the-box ...but the combination of Sonarworks True-Fi + Schiit Fulla 2 tames these DT 990s very nicely (and I"d rather tame a sparkling but overenthusiastic pair like these rather than try to force energy and detail into a boring but flat pair).

I have had the non Bluetooth wireless version for a couple of years and use it with our Qnap NAS. I leave the dongle in a spare USB socket and when I turn the keyboard on it is available immediately. The build quality is good and the battery seems to last forever with occasional use. In short, I really like it. It has all the keys I need and it is well thought out imo.
I have just bought this Bluetooth version to use with my new Lenovo tablet (Tab 4 8 Plus). I needed the BT version as the old wireless dongle would not work using a OTG USB socket.
First impressions were that the box had a sticker that looked authentic. Secondly, it has the old fashioned larger USB socket so it may be an old design. I looked at it very closely and it looks genuine to me.
I switched on BT on the tablet and the pairing key on the keyboard and they paired quickly. A message popped up and disappeared before I had the chance to read it properly. After subsequently hunting through the Android settings I think it was asking whether I wanted to have the old virtual keyboard up on screen at the same time when using this physical keyboard. I said no as one of the reasons to use an external keyboard sometimes is that the virtual one obscures parts of the screen that I need to see.
Overall it works ok. I am typing this review on it and using two fingers it is at least as fast as the virtual keyboard and maybe a bit faster. There are also times when typing on your lap is easier than reaching over and typing on the screen. I usually use the SwiftKey keyboard which is so good that I thought I would miss it"s excellent predictive word functionality but I don"t really. It is a bit early to say how it could be better but it seems to use the same spell check/autocorrect system as Swiftkey so there are not many errors when typing. It does not autocapitalise at the beginning of each sentence which is irritating and probably other minor defects will show up. There may be a way to fix some of these, as I say it is too early to say.
However all is not sweetness & light and there are bigger problems. The main one appears very serious imo. When I ordered the keyboard I made sure it had a UK layout and you can see clearly in the pictures that it does. The problem is that the keyboard still has US mapping so that the keys ignore what is printed on them and do their own thing ;)  I should say again that I am using it on an Android tablet and it may be that it will be mapped correctly on other devices/platforms but personally I doubt it. I could live with the old @" swopped keys chestnut as you get used to it but what makes it not acceptable to me is that there is no way I have found to type the GB pound symbol. I will not be able to live with this but it may be possible to get an android app to change the mapping. If there is I will come back and edit this review - if is still like this then I have been unsuccessful so Caveat Emptor.
EDIT: Some good news. Today a much more expensive Logitech tablet keyboard arrived and it also has a UK layout of keys. After pairing it with the tablet I got the exact same behaviour of the keys being mapped incorrectly. I went on thr Logitech support site and downloaded an app which fixed regional keyboard issues. All I had to do was to tell it I was using a UK keyboard and all the keys started working properly. I am not sure if the app remapped them or maybe there was a simple setting in the Android settings that I should have changed. The good news is that it is not an issue with the Rii i8 and it can be fixed. So dont let it put you off buying it - you might have to fiddle around a bit but it will not be hard. Maybe just in settings or maybe download an app.
The other problem I have found sounds like a minor niggle but is serious imo. This is that there is no indicator light that shows you have the Caps Lock key pressed. The problem with this is that you can press it and then easily forget to switch it off and because you are looking at the keyboard to type and not the screen, when you do look up you can find you have typed a sentence or sometimes more, all in capital letters. You then have to delete it all and type it again - grrr ! I find this a surprising omission considering how so many things are well thought out eg left/right mouse clicks etc and they have packed so much functionality into such a small space. It is a real shame because I can"t see any possibility that it can be fixed. I am going to email Riitek and tell them about this and a couple of other ideas I have and suggest they could give me a replacement keyboard if they change it :)
EDIT: Just to say that the Logitech keyboard which costs 4 x the Rii also does not have a Caps lock light :(
So, to sum up - it is cute little thing that could be useful but has a small flaw.', '2019-03-13T17:32:52+00:00', '1', 'false', '3652', '24') ;
INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('9522', 'I bought the Rii8 bluetooth version and wish I had bought the dongle only version instead.  I like the keyboard but there are issues with this bluetooth version and the raspberry pi.
I wanted to use this to connect with Raspberry Pi"s both in headed and headless configuration.  I am experienced with Linux and very able to learn and follow instructions.  However, I could not get this to work at all on any Debian distro (inc Raspbian Stretch).  The unit will pair but does not work as a HID - at least on Stretch at the time of writing.
I can not blame Rii soley.  Having researched it seems many people have no issue on the Pi but many others do.  The dongle only version seems to be a lot more reliable and less fuss than the Bluetooth version.
To be fair, I must  say that it would connect with Windows without any issue and performed very well in this application.  The actual keyboard is well made, easy to use and very good value.  I am certain it would make a great media center input device.
The keys are soft and rubberised (reminds me of a ZX80!) and the backlighting works very well.  All characters are available - I like coding and would certainly use the Rii to do small edits in code but I would not want to write an application from scratch with it.
The device is meant to connect via Bluetooth OR via the included USB dongle.  I have read the instructions but am still a bit uncertain of why the dongle is included.
Rii have obviously spent time and effort making a useful and neat little keyboard, my only complaint is the issues with the Rpi.', '2019-03-23T17:32:52+00:00', '2', 'false', '3652', '419') ;

The keys werent typing what they should ect. I sussed out what that was all about.  This keyboard does indeed type what it says on the keys. Its a UK keyboard. So the problem is the apps were using are USA ect based so not quite synced with our uk keyboard. So we want to type @ for instance and it shows something else. To get @ you need to shift and 2 i think.  So its not the keyboard, its the apps. The reason i know this is i paired it to my laptop on windows 10 with bluetooth and tested it in Google and all the symbols typed what they say on the key.  £ and @ is on the right key.  Everythings just like it is on a normal uk laptop.  It works fine with Firestick 4K, you get used to where the alternative keys are. But for just searching and controlling the apps its fine. Keep the remote handy to swap with now and again for certain buttons in certain apps but they are few. If you think your touchpad isnt working on an app keep in mind its easy to switch the touchbar off by accident when you fiddle with the buttons.  Fn along with F6 or F8 switches the touchpad back on again,  or just swith the keyboard off and on again.
I noticed a lot of people are saying their touchpad isnt very responsive and the arrow or cursor is slow. Well thats easy fixed as well, iv got a great tip for that.  Hold down Fn and the spacebar and it cycles through the touchpad speeds, its slow by default. Each time you press Fn and spacebar it gets faster. It goes to about level 3 or 4  then it goes back onto slow again. Just do that and keep trying the speed each time till its fast enough. I just use the page up n down at the right hand side or the top right pad for scrolling.  If you speed the cursor or pointer up the 2 finger scrolling is too fast but id rather have a faster pointer speed to get about the screen.  Also you get a bluetooth dongle with it as my laptop doesnt have bluetooth and once i plugged it in it was instantly bluetooth enabled and found my mini keyboard and paired with it. A bluetooth dongle alone would cost upwards of £6 and you get one with this.
This is a great little keyboard and im very happy with it now iv sussed out what its about.

 Something to note most blue tooth devices all operate in the 2.4ghz wireless range if you pc has a cheap network card you may need to check for interference affecting network speeds, any issues depending on the amount of Bluetooth devices operating at once just make sure your htpc is plugged in via LAN and not wifi this is a better option anyway.
Overall the keyboard is great to use remember to set up mouse driver settings in windows for mouse sensitivity etc..

Have used them for a few hours and they sound good. Don"t really believe the notion about having to burn headphones in. I think it is a bit of a myth. These sound great right out of the box.
Sound is well balanced and the stereo image pretty wide. I got these as a replacement for some AKG 44s because the elastic on the self adjusting band came loose but I really liked the self adjusting system on those ones and these ones have the same one. I was unfortunate with that happening on my other headphones, after about 4 months use, considered, just a bit if bad luck, hopefully these ones won"t  suffer from the same issue.
I saw some reviews elsewhere, There are not many, at this time as these are fairly new on the market.  One said they had a weak bass response or that they sounded boxy Don"t know what they are talking about.. I haven"t found that at all.
The frequency range of these phones according to the AKG site, is 18hz - 20,000khz As the adult human ear can only hear 20 hz to around 18,000 hz which gradually reduces as you age. For reference. The bottom note on a full sized 88 note piano is 27.5 hz the top note is 4,186 Hz.
These cover a perfectly adequate spectrum. I think the stereo image sounds a shade wider than the K44s did and they are even more comfortable to wear
Top range is not too bright or harsh. Mid range is clearly represented. Bass is rich and detailed, without being over emphasised just like the K44s were. The top band on these K52s is made of metal instead of plastic like the K 44s and they have replaceable earpads, which the earlier model didn"t have. Though no instructions come in the box to tell you how to do so but the fact that they have them, gives the impression, they expect these headphones to last a fair while. Have to look on YouTube to find for a video on how to do it, if I need to.
The cable is 2.5 metres or 8ft 2 inches long and build quality, very reasonable at this price under £30.
Tried various types of music through them, including some of my own and. all the detail was represented. As I played each instrument on these tracks, I would have noticed if sounds were muffled or missing.
These I bought to use on my Nexus 10 tablet and they are fairly  loud. I have to make sure not to have the volume up all the way.
I compared these to my old Audio Technica ATH M30 headphones which I use on my computer upstairs, the AKG52s have much more bass response than those do and probably slightly less treble, that impression was born about  when I checked the frequency response quoted for each of them the K52s quoting 18hz - 20,000khz and the M30s quoting  20hz - 20,000khz. The bass difference, is very noticeable between these two, the treble sounding smoother and less harsh on the K52s, though both are quoting the same figure for that top frequency range. Sound isolation very good much better than the ATH M30s, though to be fair, they are getting on a bit...
All in all very pleased with them at this budget price.. Just hope the self adjusting band holds up this time.
See my AKG K44 review for that story... The AKG52s have similarities to those but I actually think they sound a bit better, seem a better quality build too, let"s hope time proves me correct.', '2018-06-27T17:32:52+01:00', '0', 'false', '3747', '898') ;

The Sennheisers give you head fatigue fairy quickly, but the AKGs I can wear for hours at a time, without the feeling of having your head squashed in a vice and having an eyeball pop out all while Joe Pesci is shouting at you.
From an aural honestly point of view, they are certainly letting me hear what"s going on in the mix and most importantly, at least for me, is it they don"t add any "sparkle" to the highs. No longer do the post-mix high-hats sound like someone hitting a wet pillow with a spatula.

I don"t want to sound like I"m bragging, but I have tons of headphones, some sets that I have are almost 5 times the amount of this set, so here"s my honest review of the AKG 52"s.
-Design
Design wise, the AKG"s are nothing particularly special. The design is non offensive and generally subtle. I do like how the "L" and "R" indicators are located in the ear cups, and they"re nice and big so you always know which way round the set goes.
The cable is nice and thick, about 2 meters in length.
It has a self-adjustable headband which I was originally sceptical about, but in reality it"s a really good idea. The set just relaxes into a nice position.
Please note: The set does not fold, or twist, so it may not be an ideal choice for DJ"s or people who need something more compact.
The earcups are pretty large and I"m sure will fit over most ear sizes.
The build quality is of a high standard.
-Comfort
These headphones are nice and light. Due to the self-adjustable headband, the headset doesn"t really need any cushioning. You could wear this set for hours and it would never be a problem.
I"d consider these to be more for home audio use than on the move, and I wouldn"t recommend them for gym use. They would just keep slipping off your head.
-Sound
I honestly struggle to find anything I do not like about this set. The sound is nicely balanced, bass is neat and we"ll driven, but is not overwhelming or muddy. The mids and highs and crisp and easy to identify even if the music is bass-heavy. Music through the headphones is exciting and clean.
There is SO MUCH SPACE. I cannot emphasize how spacial these headphones sound. (If you"re thinking "what the heck is this guy on about" I"m sure there is an audiophile glossary that can explain what space is in relation to headphones).
These are actually my go-to set for music.
As for the cons, they are pretty minimal. If you like really energetic bassy trance-style music and you like being thumped in the head by the bass, I would probably advise going elsewhere. (I would normally recommend Sony for this kind of music). The AKG"s produce more of a warm, natural sound.
If anything the set may be a little too warm sounding at times, which is great if you"re listening to acoustic music, classical, jazz or smooth hip-hop...etc. I listen to a lot of Heavy Metal, and although I"m more than happy to listen to metal through these headphones, I feel like some headsets may deliver a bit of a better experience, but in honesty, I"m nit-picking.
For £30 they do a stellar job. I feel as though this set should be priced around the £50-£60 range, so £30 is a bargain.', '2018-10-12T17:32:52+01:00', '0', 'false', '3747', '1159') ;

They feel solid and are super comfortable. That"s what I enjoy the most about these headphones - no discomfort whatsoever even after having them on for 5-6 hours a day at work. Still working perfectly after 6 months even though they fall of my desk a few times a day.
Sound quality is great, although you wouldn"t need to try very hard in order to spot the difference between these and higher end models.

-  Buy this for watching films with headphones or listening to pop/light rock/classical/indie/country.Clear sound, detailed, balanced. Dialogues are amazing.
 - Don"t buy this if looking for bass, no way. Don"t buy this for comuting, they don"t have external noise reduction at all and they have the 3m cable. The ear caps are massive, so if you have a "small" head don"t even try.

These things are the complete opposite!  I can hear EVERYTHING going on, even myself trying to type quietly right now while wearing them, every keystroke is almost as loud as if I wasn"t wearing them at all.
I also own a pair of Samson open back headphones, and they are EXACTLY like these in that I can hear everything around me (annoying when the AKG site boasts "Closed-back design
maximizes isolation").
There is also what sounds like a small screw rolling arounf in the Right ear cup, which is bloody annoying!
Sound quality wise, they are as expected.  quite neutral, but with great frequency response and clarity.  Bass is deep and punchy, but not overpowering and boomy.  Mids and highs are nice and crisp, but ever so slightly tinny.
The foam pads are a little on the firm side, adding to the lack of sound isolation as they do not form around the side of your head very well (this was not the sole cause of the lack of isolation though, as pressing the earcups firmly into my head made little difference).
I would have loved these headphones, if not for the lack of isolation and the loose part inside the right cup.
If you want a pair of cans that block out a decent amount of ambient sounds, these are NOT the cans for you.', '2018-09-22T17:32:52+01:00', '0', 'false', '3747', '985') ;

The actual construction does feel a tiny bit cheap, though they look very good, but there"s a lot of plastic and the lack of a removable cable is a shame, but they"re small gripes and in a sense, it"s good that the cost appears to have all gone into the sound, which is the important thing at the end of the day.

These are great headphones. Extremely comfortable and a nice headband that self-adjusts, requiring, and indeed allowing, no manual adjustment by the wearer. The sound is great and very neutral to my ears. No excessive bass or highs but a full sounding mid-range, well-balanced and full. The cable cannot be detached however and for my purposes is far, far too long, trailing around and tying me in knots in bed and sitting in an armchair. I hate the cable but some people may like this if their stereo source is in a foreign country perhaps. Quality is excellent and they feel as though they will last a long time. There is no creaking when moving your head from side to side and the whole unit feels well made. I can recommend these, especially with the built-in skipping rope length cable that allows you to keep fit while listening, assuming you haven"t broken your legs tripping over it while making a cup of tea.', '2018-10-11T17:32:52+01:00', '0', 'false', '3747', '659') ;

On the box it says "studio", and I guess that"s really what they are for - for use in a recording or editing suite, or on an electronic piano where you want to hear exactly what the output is like.
There"s no distortion I can hear and the sound is clear, but they are relatively quiet on a mobile phone or tablet (which is about the device, not the headphones maybe?). There are no volume/other controls on the headphone itself.  They are large and bulky, and I would say that that, combined with the long lead, makes that a probable no for commuting.

I didn"t know it was going to be such a technical process because apparently a mouse is not a one-size-fits-all product. I have smallish hands so I did some research and found a website that explains how to measure your hand and the dimensions you should be looking for. Who knew? Size sorted, I had several other criteria for my mouse. I have a lingering shoulder injury and considered that a "low profile" mouse might be better than one 5-6cm high. I then wanted something responsive and quiet. It also needed to look nice and be affordable, since I was purchasing this myself; I wasn"t fussed on extra buttons to navigate back and forth, I doubt I"d ever use them. Lastly, being impatient, I wanted it the next day! And so I arrived at the Jelly Comb 2.4G which fit all of my requirements. The difficult bit was deciding which colour, a genuinely difficult decision! I settled on the very sexy-looking black and gold. It arrived the next day as promised and once I"d tracked down a battery and plugged in the little dongle*, I was up and running. The mouse looks and feels very sleek and well made. The black section that your hand rests on feels smooth and comfortable and the low-profile height has been a great change. I would definitely recommend this if you"re looking for a swish, reliable and affordable wireless mouse.
*I work from a laptop plugged into a docking station. When the laptop is docked, the dongle must be inserted into the docking station USB for the mouse to work; undocked, I need to switch it to the laptop USB.

It’s got a quality look and feel, the white and silver one looks like it could be an Apple product.
The roller ball works perfectly and is bigger than an Apple one so has a better feel. When you push it it has a positive click. The right and left sides have positive but very quiet clicks as well.
The only thing missing is the squeeze function to bring up all the active applications on screen at once. This for me is a good thing, because I was forever accidentally activating this function with my Apple Might Mouse. You can still achieve this function by pressing the F3 Key, so not only is it not missed, it’s better to use F3 in my opinion.
It’s easy to set up, just put a battery in the mouse, plug the wireless dongle into the USB on the keyboard where the wired mouse would go and it works. There’s literally nothing else to do apart from start using it.

I had an HP mouse and thought that this would be better, as the on/off switch on that mouse is hard to use, you have to poke your fingernail in. Now I see why. When using this new mouse the switch keeps moving out of position as you move the mouse around. The scroll wheel is also stiff and clicky.

I bought this in October 2018 for my new laptop as I wanted a fresh look and style. It"s whisper-quiet, low-profile, and great build quality surely amounted to its later performance. I may have gotten a faulty unit, perhaps, though I had told the seller about my issues to which they dispatched a replacement which has seemingly done the same. Unsure as to if it"s my laptop (doubtful), the batteries I"m using (over the few I"ve used and tested with decently-sized remaining charge, none of them seemed to fix the stuttering I experience), or perhaps just a fault with the mouse connectivity (likely, as taking the batteries out and putting them back in changes nothing but the red laser light on the bottom).
While my experience with these mice so far has been terrible, I do thank the seller for their cooperation and support during the arising issues with the first mouse - Their quality of communication, however, does not bring down nor bring up the rating I"ll be giving as I am reviewing the product and not the seller or delivery time like some do.
In the meantime, I"ll be ordering a new mouse and if issues come up with that one then I will consider checking thoroughly as to what the issues are - Though this is extremely unlikely as I am ordering from a named brand which should prove relevant in the mouse quality and lasting time.
Thanks for your time, and don"t let this put you off getting this mouse - Check other reviews first!

*IN RELATION TO ONE STAR REVIEWS*
I, and apparently several other people reviewing this product have had an issue where the PC simply would not boot up, and got stuck at POST. What this, is basically the computer checking that everything"s where it"s meant to be, and if you buy it as a stand alone many of your ancillaries may be "foreign" to it and not function correctly.
1: Remove ALL ancillaries and the power cable.
2: Hold down the power button for 10-20 seconds to discharge any residual charge in the capacitors.
3: Replace the power cable, and power on, if all seems normal proceed with monitor, mouse and keyboard.
Adding these after the PC boots up allows it to "acknowledge" these components as new, since it"s "seen them come in". They"re not bit"s of unexpected hardware it"s booted up with. With regards to customer service I can"t speak to it one way or another, but maybe this will help some of you.', '2019-03-08T17:32:52+00:00', '2', 'false', '4084', '880') ;

When I unwrapped the computer the DVD drive was pushed back into the casing and loose. I repackaged the computer ready to return the product and emailed the seller using details on the leaflet inside the box.
The seller responded by the following morning with a video on how to resolve the DVD issue without tools or experience.
It worked to a degree* so I connected the computer and plugged it in.
The computer was easy to set up, much faster than I expected and works well.
Wifi was via a dongle enclosed and took seconds to connect.
My only comment and minor complaint is the description says "This Certified Refurbished product is tested and inspected to look and work like-new, with limited to no signs of wear".

I would recommend this music to anyone who likes a combination/variety as mentioned above. It would be nice to see them live in concert, that would be nice and emotional. They do express themselves well and will always be a group that I like. I have good memories of this music.
I would not compare this music because it is in a league of its own and it really is very good music.

Available in three colours, Black/Gold, White, and the one I went for, Midnight Teal. This mouse has a total of seven buttons, all of which are programmable by downloading the Logitech software. The software is called Logitech Options and is available from their website. In the software, as well as programming buttons, you can change the pointer speed. And that"s about it.
This isn"t a gaming mouse though, so of course there"s no lights on it to change the colour of etc and the DPI of the pointer is only 200 – 4000 and these can only be set in an increment of 50.
That"s ok though for most professional users. But it doesn"t give you any info of what setting this is currently set to, it just has a slider. That"s it.
Programming buttons was as easy as it should be. For each button you get a selection of functions that you can select from, or you can create a macro. This was easy enough to do.
The mouse has two ways to connect to your PC. It comes with a USB wireless receiver, and it also has Bluetooth built in. But you should know that your PC must have "Bluetooth Low Energy Technology" for it to work. My PC doesn"t but my laptop does, therefore my PC has the USB receiver plugged in and my laptop just connects via Bluetooth. Both work very well I might add. The mouse connects first time EVERY time with no delays. You can also pair this mouse with up to three devices. There is a button at the bottom you can press to toggle through the three device profiles when needed, more on this later. They can even have different button layouts for each.
The thumb rest is also a button itself as with Logitech"s other MX models. Pressing this will allow you to view all the apps you have running at the time. Very handy. But of course this can be reprogrammed too. The thumb area has a rubberised coating which feels quite nice on the thumb but I will say I preferred the Performance MX thumb grip to this one as it had more grip.
The rubberised area stops as it meets the back and top of this mouse. Here it turns to a plastic material which does have a slight mat coating which feels OK when the palm is resting on it and so far doesn"t seem to make me sweat while using it, which is always a plus.
The far side where your pinky finger rests is also rubberised for comfort. This makes lifting the mouse all the much easier unlike their earlier G602 gaming mouse.
The thumb side of the mouse has a side scrolling wheel and two buttons. I must say the placement of these buttons could have been better thought out. They seem to have squashed them together. I think it would of worked better if there was just one button either side of the scroll wheel.
I have reprogrammed these buttons to be cut and paste as I do a lot of file management on my computer systems so I use those functions all the time.
The side scrolling wheel is of a beautiful quality. I could scroll this wheel all day as I love the smoothness of it. Unfortunately that"s where my love for this wheel dies a death. The rubberised grip on the wheel attracts dust and small debris. Once something is stuck inside the grip it is very hard to remove it. Also I don"t really often have a reason to side scroll really. Seems a bit of a novelty. Unless you use spreadsheets a lot. There is good news though. You can reprogramme it. You don"t have as many options with this though. For example you cant assign a macro to this wheel. But what I did was select the "page back and forwards" option. This means when I scroll upwards it goes a page forwards and when I scroll downwards it goes backwards. This might seem a little weird at first but I got used to it surprisingly fast.
The main vertical scroll wheel has the "free-wheel" function MX users will be used to. By default the button above the wheel engages and releases the gears of the wheel. This way if your looking through a long document or webpage, you can press this button to disengage the gears and the wheel will spin freely, allowing you to scroll down or up extremely fast. I personally decided to change this button to "Save", and then enable the "SmartShift" option in the software. This means that the gears will stay engaged on the wheel. But if I give the wheel a sharp spin it will sense this and automatically switch the wheel into free spin mode. It will then re-engage the gear after it stops. And this works really well! I love this feature. And you can even set the sensitivity of this.
OK so the feature that really sold this mouse to me was the FLOW system. Enabling this in the software means you can drag the mouse pointer to the edge of the screen on you PC and then it will appear on the screen of your Laptop. It is quite handy if you often use your laptop on your PC desk at the same time while using your PC. This way you can use just one mouse for the two computers and amazingly you can even copy files from one to another. You press copy on your PC for example, then move your mouse to your laptop screen and click paste. Whallah! Unfortunately you can"t drag and drop files but that"s not a big problem.
So all in all this mouse is impressive in certain ways and a let down in others. I feel the mouse needs more buttons. One or two more on top like the G602, and one or two more OR just a reconfigure of button placement on the side. The thumb wheel, although a nice novelty, it needs to  have more programmable options to be useful.
The size and ergonomics of the mouse is good and I wouldn"t say much improvement is needed there. But the feel of it could be nicer. The battery seems to be amazing. I"ve had it just over 2 months and I"ve only charged it once since it came out of the box. The battery indicator was on two lights when I opened it and it is was still on two lights after over 2 weeks usage. It boasts up to 70 days of use between charges and it seems to be telling the truth.
What"s great though is it"s supplied with a USB cable which you can plug into the front of the mouse in order to charge it and keep on using it while you do. Brill!
Another quick mention too is the dark field laser technology which is superb. This mouse will work on even clear glass as long as it"s a minimum of 4mm thick. And the range of this mouse is 10m.

For years I swore in the Magic Mouse and after that the Magic Trackpad 2 which were always my primary external peripherals. I hesitated for long time to buy the MX Master 2S, but everyone on youtube was recommending it and I decided to give it a try. I am so happy I did.
PROS
- great customisation - almost every button can be set to run different keyboard commands based on app used. There"s a very nice implementation of the Mac OS commands (by using only the button where the thumb rests) such as Mission Control, Show Desktop, App Expose, switch fullscreen apps/desktops (see attached screenshot)
- very good battery life (I get several weeks of usage)
- very comfortable (needs some getting used to after the Magic Mouse, but not so much)
- nice sliding on my desk without need for mousepad (the Magic Mouse 2 is much worse in this regard)
- ability to quickly switch between 3 devices by pressing the small button under the mouse
- flow software to go from the screen of one computer to another is great addition (although it lags a bit for few seconds, so it"s not like you have external monitor plugged in, but works the same - you go to the edge of one screen and you are on to the next one)
CONS (a little nitpicking)
- the scroll is not as smooth as the Magic Mouse" capacitive surface, but still one of the best on a regular mouse with a wheel
- no battery percentage in the Logi app, not even in the Mac bluetooth menu icon
- needs USB-C, I"m tired of this Micro-USB
- can"t set the side scroll wheel to run keystroke commands
- can"t export settings from the Logi app and import them on another computer
- gets dirty easier than the Magic Mouse and it"s harder to clean
I would usually rate this at 4.5 stars, but if the cons are resolved (or at least half of them), it would be a true 5-star-product.

In fact, there"s never been anything wrong with my Logitech mice, I"ve always just decided to upgrade to the next in line.
For a short period, before buying the MX Master 2S, I had the MX Master. So I was confident it was going to be a good mouse from the off. The 2S has a much longer battery life and 4000dpi vs 1600dpi. Also has some software perks which allows you to use multiple computers as linked desktops. Pretty cool as I do a fair amount of server work and video editing.
I do miss the bronze colour though!
I can"t recommend this mouse enough, it"s one of the best devices on the market, feels great to hold for hours on end and doesn"t make your hand ache or sweat. It"s beautifully designed (for right handed people!) and feels like a quality product.

My primary issue is that it has an even smaller profile than previous models.  I have small hands and even for me it feels uncomfortable.
Secondly, my instant reaction when I took out of the box was that it feels cheap. They"ve used plastic that tries to look like metal and even the wheel has that fake shiny chrome effect on it you get on really cheap plastic goods.  It has an obvious seam at the back and front and the non stick pads on the underneath look like they"ve got greasy scuff marks on them.  Even the new lowercase logo feels unoriginal and last decade. It all just seems a bit substandard for an expensive mouse.

I"ve used a Magic Mouse for many years, but was looking for something maybe a bit better for my hand / wrist.
The scroll wheel on the Logitech MX Master 2S that I received was unbalanced.  I would push the scroll wheel forward, in order to zoom in / scroll. Most of the time, as soon as I took my finger (carefully) away, the wheel would roll back in the opposite direction, appearing to rebalance itself, and consequently undoing the zoom / scroll that I"d just done.
It should be noted that there is a way to set the wheel so it clicks as it moves, which I find quite noisy (I"m not used to it), and also tiring when working in CAD.  I prefer "free wheeling", but the lack of balance made the mouse unusable for me.  I searched this specific term online, and there appears to be other people with a similar problem.
As a side note, I also found the button that is under the thumb rest pad very difficult to press, although I guess it has to be or you"d be accidentally pressing it all the time.  I noticed this very early on, when setting the mouse up, but that alone didn"t deter me as I don"t need loads of button commands.  But an unbalanced scroll wheel is a complete non-starter.

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('10586', 'This is a beautiful looking laptop and a serious competitor to Apple Macbook Pro and Microsoft"s Surface products. Incredibly compact given the size of the screen, and the edge-to-edge display in particular is amazing and bigger, brighter and more vibrant than for example the Microsoft Surface products. I love the 3:2 aspect ratio screen which is so much more useful than the typical screens found on almost all other laptop brands. Haven"t used it much yet, but I"m sure the i5 processor and 256GB performance will be more than adequate for most needs. The keyboard is great to type on - far superior to the latest macbook and almost as good as the surface laptop, and the sound quality is pretty good for a small laptop. Also comes with a useful selection of ports including the much maligned but very practical and durable legacy USB-A, and future proof USB-C, and even an extra dongle, along with a compact USB-C fast charger.
I also appreciate the fact that, unlike the Macbooks and Surface products it can be opened up to replace or upgrade the SSD. Don"t know how much else might actually be repairable or upgradable, but at least the device doesn"t need to go back to the OEM just to open the case. Be aware that Huawei state that opening up the device for any reason, even just to upgrade the SSD, will void the warranty.
However, it is expensive for what it is, and there are a few things that I feel let it down. 1. The fan seems to run a lot and it can get quite hot occasionally and battery life, while good falls short of the best in class competitors. The exact same i5 processor running in a Microsoft surface product runs cooler and quieter - perhaps driving the higher resolution display is the issue. I imagine the i7 versions of the matebook X Pro will be noisier and hotter still, while also having shorter battery life, so unless you really need the extra power or RAM for gaming or video editing or similar I really wouldn"t go for the i7 versions. 2. The track pad, although smooth and a wonderful large size, has an slight rattle to it that you might expect on a much cheaper product. Maybe I was just unlucky and got a faulty unit. 3. The pop-up camera is an interesting novelty, but in all honesty is not hugely practical due to the odd position and angle. 4. The laptop isn"t pen-enabled; although the laptop has an excellent and responsive touchscreen, none of the styluses I tried, even simple passive styluses, work well with it, and Microsoft"s inking functions in Windows and Office aren"t therefore accessible. This won"t seem much of a loss for some users, but if you do have any hopes for inking and sketching then you should look elsewhere for a machine with active pen support. 5. Finally, I question Huawei"s ability to provide prompt service, support and repairs in the UK yet. Devices at this price point really should be backed up with first class support services. Firms like Apple can somewhat justify their high prices by their comprehensive network of support services, but it"s hard to say that for Huawei.
Overall, its a really nice laptop that in many ways exceeds even the very best of the competition, so it is certainly well worth considering. However, Huawei still have a little more to do to make this a truly outstanding device. You certainly won"t go badly wrong buying this laptop, but if you aren"t in a hurry perhaps it"s worth waiting for the next iteration to give Huawei time to iron out the little bugs and more time to build up and prove their UK support services.', '2018-09-10T17:32:52+01:00', '0', 'false', '4299', '528') ;

I started using the Matebook X Pro on 20th December 2018 and now that I"ve used it for just over a month I thought I"d leave a review of what I think of it.
Prior to buying this I had a 2015 13" MacBook Pro with i5, 8GB and 256GB SSD.  I couldn"t justify paying £2200+ for a new MBP and so did lots of research on what to replace it with.
I am a photographer and it was important to me that the replacement met my needs of being powerful enough to run Lightroom Classic and Photoshop CC quickly and smoothly; had a screen that was much higher resolution than the 2560x1600 my MBP did; was lightweight and had both USB-C and USB-A ports.  I also wanted to pay less than £2K it.
In the i7, 16GB, 512GB version, this Matebook X Pro 13.9 is the perfect laptop for me.  And it cost a lot less than £2K.  I see that is now even cheaper at £100 less than I paid so it"s an absolute steal now!
The gorgeous 3000 x 2000 3:2 aspect screen shows my photos off brilliantly. It is bright and full of colour. I have a Spyder5Pro monitor calibrator and when I calibrated the screen it was so well set up out of the box that it didn"t change by much at all afterwards.
Editing my photos on the Matebook X Pro works like a dream. Lightoom Classic and Photoshop CC are speedy to use (although perhaps not as fast as I was expecting from the i7 and 16GB spec).  It was a bit fiddly to get Lightroom to recognise the Nvidia graphics card but once I set that up, LR CC is pretty speedy.
The 512GB SSD is plenty big enough especially as a 2TB external HDD is only about £60.
One thing that others have mentioned is that it comes with a very handy freebie: a Matedock 2 dongle that plugs into the USB-C port and gives you 1 x USB-A, 1 x VGA, 1 x HDMI and 1 x USB-c port. This is brilliant and saved me buying one. It would have been nice to get an SD port too but I solved that by buying this cheap, but excellent, USB-C to SD port dongle: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07GNTFHFH/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1
I was worried about switching from Mac OS, which I thought was brilliant and so much better than Windows 7, to Windows 10 but I needn"t have worried: Windows 10 has caught up and possibly exceeded Mac OS and I don"t miss Mac OS at all.  And I certainly don"t miss having to find Mac versions of useful utilities that are easily available on Windows.
Other things I don"t miss is the MacBook Pro trackpad. It was the best I"d ever used in 2015 but the Matebook"s trackpad is just as good, if not better!  The fingerprint scanner / power button is really responsive and works a treat. The keyboard is really good too.
The laptop is very lightweight, battery life is good and the charger is very compact.
I like the hidden webcam. I haven"t used it yet but not having it at the top of the screen means that the screen bezels are really small. In fact they are so small that it took me a while to get used to looking so far up the screen to see the top of the screen!
Talking of the screen, this brings me to the only negative I can see. And that is the disappointing touchscreen.  Although it works well when selecting things using touch it is really disappointing that it isn"t compatible with a smart pen. And that Lightroom Classic and Photoshop CC don"t support using the touchscreen to paint or touch up photos. So I don"t tend to use the touchscreen much.

The finger print reader is built into the power button and performs flawlessly - just one press is required to power on and sign in via Windows Hello.

There are a few minor negatives
1.  The price of the 16GB model is significantly higher than the 8GB.  £200 is a lot of money for an extra 8GB RAM but it isn"t upgradeable.
2.  The 16GB top of the range model only comes with Windows 10 Home but the mid-level model comes with Pro.  This is bizarre and slightly annoying - I think a laptop costing this much should come with the Pro edition.  I paid for an upgrade key.
3. The bundled dock is useless as it has no ethernet port.
4.  The keyboard is backlit but the backlighting times out after a few seconds and will only come on again with a keypress.  This is annoying when working in dim lighting and can"t be changed.
5.  No active pen support for the screen.

So because I"m going overseas in 3 weeks I needed a decent ultrabook after returning the disappointing HP Envy 13,3 AMD Ryzen 7 so I was literally "forced" to choose the i7-855OU configuration when I"d read in a few reviews that the benchmarks for both models are basically equall because of processor throttling on the i7 855OU which I can see with medium heavy work it heats up to throttling levels worse even than the HP.

Days later...
Overall I"m very happy with it but there"s another very annoying - if minor - defect. The battery level indications vary crazily in terms of the estimated time available. Sometimes (like now) with 68% of the battery left the estimated life reads as > 9hrs, which is nonsense. At other times a similar level will indicate an estimated 2 hrs - with an almost identical load, ie a few browser tabs and a standard set of utility apps running. Such nonsensical variation in the indications makes them completely worthless.
even later
The stupid battery reporting continues. In the hope of fixing this I reluctantly decided to install the Huawei maintenance utility. Reading the EULA it appears that I now have a member of the People"s Liberation Army resident in my home. It installed about five driver updates (why doesn"t the MS update recognise these?) but seems to have no effect on the nonsensical battery reporting.

I poured over reviews, watched countless YouTube videos and even went as far as venturing in to shops to see them. On that last point, alas I was only able to physically see the Dell.
After looking at the spec"s of each and their costs relative to each other, I eventually took a punt on the Huawei - the discrete graphics and 3000x2000 resolution being two key factors. It is, quite simply, a stunning laptop. No picture you have seen or video you have watched will do justice to its subtle looks. They will do nothing to convey the tactile feel of its aluminium body, its lightness, how good the keyboard is, how good the speakers are, how responsive the trackpad is or how well the finger sensor in the power button works. I"ll concede that the webcam positioning renders it pretty much useless but I don"t need or use a webcam so that wasn"t an issue. Plus, I"d rather have the almost bezel-free screen that not having a webcam in the usual position allows. The screen, by the way, is sensational - razor sharp and bright enough that I"m yet to encounter a situation whereby I can"t see what"s displayed as clearly as I want to. A couple of reviews I read mentioned the logo on the outside of the lid and seemed to suggest it was too large. I"m not sure if there"s a slight whiff of badge snobbery here, perhaps tinged with embarrassment but pay this particular criticism no mind.
Had I bought the Dell, I"m sure I would have been happy with it but it"s a bit too much like a work laptop for me. The Lenovo came a close second but it was slightly more expensive for a slightly lesser specification - and it would have taken over two weeks to arrive. No-one"s that patient - are they?

There is no doubting that the Matebook X Pro has one of the best specifications of any Windows laptop currently on the market. The screen and its screen to body ratio is unmatched. It"s all aluminium construction feels great. It"s exceptionally light and at the same time powerful.
However the track pad is terrible. I suggest googling "Matebook X Pro Rattle" to find further reports from owners having issues with the track pad.

First impression is that this is a very stylish looking laptop with its colour (grey) akin to the Apple MacBook’s. The aluminium unibody coupled with its slimness and lightweight (and apparently lighter than Macbook Air) makes this laptop at the top end in terms of design. It has a full size keyboard and backlit (like MacBook), which is comfy to type on; the large trackpad is a bit wide to my liking, and may get a bit used to it.
The other selling points for me including the fingerprint sensor, which means this laptop can be turned on and signed in with a single touch, as well as the touch screen display - making the experience synonymous to using a high end mobile phone. Another unique feature of the laptop includes impressive screen to body ratio of 91 percent, unlike most of the laptops on the market. Will have to use it more for high definition videos to appreciate the experience of the display. Obviously, since I will use this a lot while on travel, its long battery life (claimed to be up to 12 hours) is a selling point, but I haven’t fully tested it
The only minor nag for me would be the pop-up camera -  while innovatively designed to be hidden discretely on the keyboard and pops up only when it is needed, unfortunately its positioning means it is quite a challenge to get a normal view of one’s face unless the laptop is held or tilted at certain angle. Overall, a good solid laptop, and its premium price make it at the high end of the market for laptops', '2019-01-28T17:32:52+00:00', '1', 'false', '4299', '1131') ;

Other things to consider: The cans are flexible in all directions and sit well on (or around) your ears but they don"t fold or swivel (like dJ classic headphone), the product is really tough but I wouldn"t say indestructible either (essentially high grade plastic with a great rubberised finish that will probably get superficially scratched with time and use -personally I don"t mind it but it might put off those who want their stuff to remain pristine for eternity- , they are also a bit "clampy" on the head so if you have a large head you should try them before buying and choose the ear pads option wisely (having said that those coming with the guru set are probably the most comfortable). More on the sound: The S04 are very sharp neodynium drivers with good tight and warm bass (not overwhelming) and a relatively flat response overall out of the box (which is a good thing unless you are a bass head I guess) and you don"t need and amp to drive them. Finally the modularity of this kit means that if a better drivers (or one with a different signature) is being released in the future (on top of the existing range) you can easily buy them and swap them for a lot less than buying whole new pair of headphones, so again hat down to AIAIA for pioneering this concept, it"s fun and most importantly it works very well.', '2018-05-29T17:32:52+01:00', '2', 'false', '4314', '88') ;

I bought these for casual home and office use. I was interested as the sound profile isn"t a flat response. I"ve had headphones like this in the past on the advice of headfi forums but I find this sound profile a tad boring. These Young Guru"s are bass boosted a tad and so is the treble; but not to the detriment of the sound. In fact if you are listening for the enjoyment of music (rather than for the analytical studio based scenario) this slight V shaped curve really adds some punch to the music, as you might expect from the E04 speaker unit"s vibrant definition. The clarity doesn"t suffer for this and most genres of music - particularly electronic and dance music sound excellent and most of all enjoyable.
On sound alone it"d be 5 stars. But unfortunately it"s let down by sub standard build quality. I"m currently on my second pair as my first set had a speaker die within the first week. Manufacturing defects are a fact of life, but on receiving my new set (delivered before my current set was returned thanks to Amazon"s excellent customer service) I noticed that the microfiber cloth that goes around the ear piece was glued in a way that meant it wouldn"t create a secure seal over the speaker. The result was that the sound stage felt firmly biased to one ear. If you press hard enough it would secure itself but I"ve already bought the low profile on ear leatherette ear pieces for on the go use and the modularity of the unit is essential to me. My previous (defective) set did not have this issue.
Its a real disappointment that I"ve received 2 defective products as I do love the sound of these headphones. Luckily I have received my new pair before I sent the old ones back so I"m able to mix and match the defective unit"s ear pads with my newer one to have a functional set of headphones.
With my experience and given that the cost is ~£160 the finish should be much higher than I experienced. I"m going to see what the longevity is like and will update the review accordingly.
I"d suggest that you buy with caution.', '2018-06-02T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '4314', '386') ;

It only takes a second for the listener to fall in love with these headphones, as they notice when a member of the orchestra (considering you are listening to classical music like Rachmaninov for example) takes a breath in synchrony with the next musical note...or for the next string to be hit on the guitar by the likes of Jimmy Page from Led Zeppelin.

  - consistent, accurate, touch-pad - Windows laptops have better touch-pads nowadays and this is excellent
  - touchscreen - superb and fairly fingerprint resistant - screen quality is phenomenal - absolutely beautiful
  - webcam - this is in the right position - beware the Dell XPS 13 which points its camera up your nose
  - speakers - surprisingly loud and surprisingly good - better than my £2k gaming laptop
3) Weight:
  - this thing weighs nothing
4) Looks:
  - Beautiful external finish
  - soft "fabric" interior - don"t worry about this - just give it a wipe with a soapy cloth every now and then and it will be fine - my daughter"s is spotless. It feels lovely
5) Performance:
  - this thing runs multiple windows and applications flawlessly - you don"t need more power
6) Battery Life:
  - six months old and still giving 8-10+ hours a day depending on use - if you are working rather than playing games, you don"t need the power block for a days work
Things that could be better:
1) If you are a power user, you might want to upgrade - you can"t - like an Apple, everything is glued & soldered in
2) Ports - yup it hasn"t got many but has more than my wife"s £2.5k Macbook Pro
3) The completely unnecessary i7 version with 16GB is laughably expensive.
Conclusion:
You will read amazing reviews about rivals:  the Dell XPS - really expensive, feels cheap, has a non-touch, not great screen as as standard (you have to pay towards £2k to get a better screen with touch) and has a pretty nasty keyboard; HP Spectre - poor battery life and keyboard, Lenovo - feels like a toy and in my experience of this brand, will break.
This is like an Apple product to me, designed just to work without any possibility of home maintenance or upgrades and it does that without the excessive "mac-tax" pricing of Apple products.
I absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants a thin"n"light, all-rounder, 13", Windows laptop.
Bought one for my daughter first and one for myself, too, because I like it so much.', '2018-12-29T17:32:52+00:00', '1', 'false', '4400', '685') ;

I haven"t had it long enough to fully try out the battery life but so far it looks very promising.
I was initially worried about the alcantara keyboard finish, but if you have also had the same concern, do not worry; it is very durable feeling, it also has a finish that prevents it from getting wet, so any liquids on it just bead and fall off. If you look after your laptop and do not use it with grubby, greasy hands, I guarantee the keyboard will look just as good a year later as when you first bought it.

There are only a couple of things I wasn"t such a fan of:
1) The screen is often far too bright. I have it turned to 0% brightness, and yet in a slightly darkened room, this thing still burns my eyes. There are no options to make it any dimmer.
2) The battery life is somewhat poor. It lasts me through the day at school, but I am still charging it every night - my MacBook, on the other hand, can go days without being charged.
3) Delivery was abhorrent. It arrived on time, but had clearly been mishandled by the postman, as one of the silica gel packets explored inside, and little plastic balls are still falling out of the vents, weeks after I"ve purchased the machine.

All in all this is a good buy, but not absolutely excellent. Beware:
1. The operating system is super fast but pointless. I really tried to stick with it, but there is NO software worth speaking of outside Microsoft"s own and some unknown apps; basically you will have to upgrade to Windows10 pro - which thankfully and for now comes for free with the machine. But a bit of a bother.
2. You will need some sort of a convertor dongle for there are only two ports on it - one of which is a USB. There is a second USB on the charger itself, but when you are on the move, that"s not very useful.
3. The actual keys on the keyboard are less than perfect. They feel plastic and too light. There is a wobble to them as well... The travel is not strictly vertical.
4. The windows pro version is a tad heavy for the low end machine. Nothing worrying at current version, but as they update Windows I expect it will become sluggish fairly quickly.
As is,I have to give it five stars for both hardware and software. Windows is pretty impressive even compared to macs these days, and despite some minor bugs it is a pleasure to own and use.', '2019-02-23T17:32:52+00:00', '0', 'false', '4400', '716') ;

UPDATE so today, just over two weeks since I order the item, I was looking at the mouse and checked online if others have had similar issues. There were some great YOUTUBE videos and I quickly dismantled mine, had a little fiddle around and noticed one of the cable clips had come of its mounting.

I have found the shape to be ergonomically designed; it fits in my palm comfortable and the small smooth grooves in the left and right buttons help keep my fingers in place and makes clicking down easier also. To get going, you just pull the plastic strip out that"s preventing the battery from connecting, plug the tiny nano receiver in to a regular 2.0 USB slot, and away you go. I love the plug & play aspect of this as there"s no timely configuration required. It only requires 1 AA battery, which is included, hence the lighter weight of the mouse. There"s also a small on/off switch on the underside if you are wary of conserving battery power, though for home use I wouldn"t say this is really necessary when your computer is off and the mouse isn"t in use.

I"ve had a few of these over the last 5 years, each previous one being replaced as a result of my own clumsiness! There"s a reason I keep coming back to these!
In the time i"ve owned Logitech wireless mice, i"ve never had to replace the battery, and that"s with heavy, everyday use (sometimes 12 hours a day) and never switching it off.
One of these was kept in my laptop bag and taken everywhere with me for around 18 months. It was dropped, bumped, knocked, and still it performed as it did when new.
I"ve always found these to be "plug and play" devices, installing themselves within seconds of plugging in the USB receiver dongle, without any required input from me.
The only issue I had with one was when it was dropped onto a hard floor from a high desk. The impact was enough to break one of the plastic retainers for the scroll wheel. A few minutes taking the mouse apart and hot gluing the broken piece back into place, and all was well!
I knocked one star off the durability rating for this product due to a small issue with the battery cover i"ve had with the last two mice. The cover doesn"t seem to "click" into place. It slides into position as normal, but it doesn"t clip closed as it should. I think this is due to the plastic "transit strip" of plastic which isolates the battery when packed, and then needs to be removed prior to product use. It"s quite thick, and therefore possibly distorts the plastic of the battery cover over time.
With all this in mind, I would still order another one without hesitation as and when my current mouse meets it ultimate demise at the hands of my cumbersome activities. Absolutely love it!', '2019-02-25T17:32:52+00:00', '2', 'false', '4526', '780') ;

Recently my Audio Technica M50s broke, so I was in the market for some new closed back headphones which would be suitable for mixing and mastering but which would be good for listening on the train as well. I personally prefer these to the M50s, I highly recommend them!
Pros
-------
+Easy to drive, you don"t really need a headphone amp.
+Relatively balanced sound, less hyped bass and treble then the M50s although I wouldn"t say they are completely flat sounding. Mid range is much more clear and it"s easier to pick apart the different instruments in a mix.
+Comfort. The M50s got painful to wear after a pretty short time. These do get hot on your ears after a while like any other closed back headphones, but the pads feel very nice.
+Isolation is great, blocks out a lot of background noise.
+Soundscape is extremely impressive for closed back cans.
+Feel really nicely made. Sturdy.
Cons
--------
-Quite heavy, you don"t forget these are on like you would with AKGs.
-The coiled cable supplied with them is pretty short, I would"ve liked a longer straight cable in the box as well.
Overall, these are great headphones which I would recommend over the very popular ATH M50X. If you like a punchier bass sound then the M50s will be more to your liking, but for mixing/mastering and listening to a lot of different styles of music, I"m sure you will love these.', '2018-10-04T17:32:52+01:00', '2', 'false', '4576', '426') ;

First impressions were the design. These phones ooze quality. Nice matte plastic. Comfy leather or pleather ear cups (you get a spare set). A coiled cable to increase both resilience and prevent tangling. They"ve thought of pretty much everything. This however comes at a cost. These are big and somewhat heavy. They look a little silly on your head, but then again, if sound reproduction is your priority, this is a negated point. Secondly, the headband feels a little flimsy. It slightly twists, but then again, not worryingly so. You can also fold the headphones due to the reversible Dj design and store them in the supplied drawstring case. A hardcase might have been a better choice, but it"s adequate.
Regarding the sound, everything I"ve listened to sounds different. Now by no means is my Onkyo 22-HDX bad at sound reproduction. But with the 840"s I can pick out nearly every instrument in a song. There is no mish mash of sounds. There is no overpowering bass or drum track. Every instrument gets it"s own recognition here. But not at the expense of the overall sound. This said, the headphones cope comfortably with classic, to rock and pop. The high"s perhaps could be a little better, but the mid and low range are fantastic. You will enjoy listening to all your music again and appreciating stuff you never though you"d heard before, but was always there.
There are a few drawbacks to mention. Certain tracks like the Narratives "Fade" have a section with some harsh guitar electric strumming (not really sure what to call it). This sounds okay with normal headphones/speaker as it blends into the track. However it can really stand out on these headphones to the point it"s painful. The same carries over to the quality of the music you listen to. 128kbps rips are easily identifiable, as are poorly encoded/transcoded files up to 320kbps. Additionally they are good at passively blocking out noise but suffer from being a little tight after a few hours.
In conclusion, whilst I listed quite a few drawbacks, these do not in any way detract from the sound quality. Quite simply, if you are looking at Monster Beats for instance, these are not for you. These are the inverse of what those phones represent.

I"ve owned them for more than three months now and I am more than happy with my choice. The sound quality is excellent. The only headphones I heard in the same price range were the AKG K271 II and they sounded thinner than the Shures.
There are two things though that I do not like about these headphones. First and most important in my opinion is the wire between the headphones which is exposed between the headband and the headphone and if you are not careful you might damage it. The second is that the headphones are pretty heavy if you are not used to wearing headphones. Don"t get me wrong, they are comfortable to wear but if you"re not used to wearing headphones and are wearing these for more than an hour your head might start to hurt.
That said they are definitely worth buying. As I said the sound quality is excellent, across all spectrum. You need to break them in for a while - their sound gets better as you use them. You are most likely need a headphone amplifier to get the most out of them. They will sound acceptably loud with a portable music player but it"s likely that you"re gonna need more than that. I use them together with a Fiio E17 DAC/headphone amplifier and it"s a wonderful experience. The headphones are very revealing and I am constantly discovering new things in old songs, things that I had no idea were in the recording. The feeling is priceless. :) The downside of this is that there will be a lot of mp3s that you won"t like listening to anymore. You"ll start hearing how bad they actually are.
I connected the headphones through the Fiio to a M-Audio Delta 1010LT  and I could feel the difference from the Fiio"s own DAC. So I"m guessing that with a better amplifier and with better DACs these headphones can sound even better.
A nice thing to add to these headphones would be the velour pads ( http://www.amazon.com/Shure-HPAEC940-Replacement-Velour-Headphones/dp/B005OM06RG/ ) which unfortunately don"t seem to be sold in Europe. They are advertised as an accessory for the next headphones in Shure"s lineup, the SRH940 but I read they fit perfectly on the 840s.
I read a lot of reviews before buying these headphones and they were an overall winner in all comparative reviews, within their price range of course. So if you"re looking for the best in this price range go ahead and buy them.', '2019-01-20T17:32:52+00:00', '0', 'false', '4576', '878') ;

This is a great machine for the money. In the box you will find the tower unit, kettle power cord and they also threw in a USB WIFI dongle which was handy (I did not ask for it but it was a most welcome surprise - however, it is actually very slow compared to alternatives you can pick up on Amazon for less than £10).
I was surprised that this Dell tower actually has basic speakers built into it, so that’s handy for system sounds if you don’t have your own speakers.
The unit was delivered as described, with Windows 10 Pro pre-loaded. There are no obvious signs of wear and tear - the cosmetic appearance is very good, much better than I was expecting.
Delivery was on time and the machine was very well packaged (loads of bubble wrap was wrapped tight around the tower and then additional air bags were used to fill the gaps within the box).
My only gripe with this machine is that it is quite noisy (I assume it’s the fan). I have never had a machine that makes this much noise before. I’m not overly concerned by it, and you will get used to it after a while, but I am comparing it to my iMac which is absolutely silent in comparison.
Whilst this PC is delivered ready to switch on and start using, I decided to completely wipe it and re-install Windows 10 Pro from fresh (it’s good practice when buying second hand units). This was easy to do using the Windows reset options, and I did not need the original CD (I also didn’t need to create a bootable drive of any sort). So if you are planning to do the same, it’s really easy but will take an hour or so.
I highly recommend this unit - it’s a great specification for the money. You will need a monitor, keyboard and mouse - I got a 27 inch Dell monitor, wired Dell keyboard and wired Dell mouse, all brand new and all from Amazon. So for the whole computer setup, it came it at around £500 which I was very happy with (good luck matching my setup at Currys PC World for that price!).

This PC is super quick. I confess I am new to the world of SSD and am seriously impressed. Does absolutely everything I need for a home PC. I read on a previous review that a purchaser had found some scratches or marks. I have examined mine and to be fair it looks new.
PC comes with windows 10 pro and a few bits of unnecessary software. Also included is a wifi dongle. The dongle is just about sufficient to update windows. I replaced it with a £10 job from Amazon and it now whizzes along.

The model I have is exactly as specified and had enough software installed to be usable immediately. Comes with power cord and USB WiFi adapter. Boots in under 20 seconds and runs all my applications (including PhotoShop) very, very quickly (PhotoShop starts and is usable in under 2 seconds). All for less than £200 !!! You can ignore the ridiculous 1 star reviews posted here, which appear to be either fake or written by dingbats. Mine is a genuine purchase, and I am writing this review using this PC.

Purchased this laptop for my wife who wanted something to be able to type up documents for work; I didn"t need anything too powerful and using "the cloud" would mean the storage would not be an issue either.
The case, looks aluminium, but of course at this price it"s plastic.  But the plastic isn"t that "flexible" type you get with other cheap devices, and looks as though it will stand up to household use.  There are some pretty decent feet on the laptop as well, meaning it doesn"t sit exactly flush with a desktop, giving room for the device to breathe, although given the specs, I"m sure heat isn"t going to be an issue.
For the price, the 14.1" HD screen is very clear indeed, and although I don"t like laptop keyboards myself (keys are too flat and square), my wife doesn"t have an issue with it.
One minor gripe about the keyboard is that the enter key (a bar shape) is directly beneath the delete key, so as I am used to using an L-shaped enter key, I found myself (a touchtyper) hitting the delete button more often than not - but I"m not going to be using it, so hey!
On first using the product, set up was exceptionally easy, and "Cortana" which I typically disable on Windows10 allowed me to do the entire set up by voice - this will no doubt be a godsend for those less technical people.  One issue I found during set up and when first using the device was the trackpad didn"t actually operate; no amount of tapping the pad had any affect - during the set up it meant I couldn"t "privatise" all the settings for Windows but would have to do this later (on reflection I could have used the keyboard to make the choices, but did this after entering Windows).
However, following some extensive Windows updates (and there were a few!), the trackpad started working again.  It is one of those trackpads, that although have a definate "click" for the L & R buttons, is also sensitive enough for a simple "tap" which I like.
One minor complaint, and I"m awaiting feedback from the seller, is that the wi-fi adaptor is a little "iffy" when it comes to range.  I have many other laptops and they all work without incident at the other end of the house, but with this device, it barely picked up a signal unless you were within about 5 meters of the router - not a real issue - but noted that the wifi is not picking up 2.4GHz band, so might be a problem for someone with an older router.
Pros: A really cheap laptop, with a decent screen and an easy set up routine for the less initiated.
Cons: Needs to be updated immediately before everything worked.  Wi-Fi adaptor is not the most powerful.
Verdict: If you need a laptop to browse the Internet, write documents and emails, for the price, this is well worth the purchase; stick a peice of fruit on the lid and you could almost mistake it for a Macbook (not that I like those!).', '2018-05-16T17:32:52+01:00', '0', 'false', '4745', '606') ;

It"s currently mid December. I have had the laptop for less than 3 months. The memory is pretty good for the price, but that"s about it. It is already on it"s last legs.
I don"t know exactly what I expected for less than £400, to be honest. You have to be sitting practically next to the modem to get decent wifi. The modem is at the bottom of the stairs, my office is at the top. When I sit at my desk I have 2 out of a possible 4 bars of wifi. Every time I disconnect from my network (something this laptop does a lot) the available wifi networks suddenly disappear until I turn it off and on again. The mouse is so sensitive I could have both hands on the keyboard and the mouse will still move to the middle of my previous sentence and I"ll end up typing in a place I don"t mean to. I"ve only touched it to turn it on and plug in the charger and there"s a hairline crack over where the charger plugs into the device, plus I"ve had to ring and ask for a replacement charger already because the charger was so poorly made. And speaking of, the charge on the laptop lasts anywhere between 10 and 2 hours after being fully charged and can go from battery saver to critical battery mode in any amount of time from an hour to 5 minutes, when I am doing the exact same thing in both situations. Despite all this, I am still a student and was willing to put up with it in the name of saving money.
But then tonight happened. For the last week or so the screen has been flickering in various places seemingly at random. No clue why. Tonight the entire thing flickered between functional and a plain black screen several times before the laptop shut itself down. I"ve lost my entire coursework plan plus 300 words of my actual coursework, 14 hours before the deadline.
I feel the need to stress again at this point that I have had this laptop for less than three months, and only use it for uni related work.
I managed to turn it back on after leaving it alone, plugged in for a solid 10 minutes, and once it came back on I immediately came here to write this, and the screen is literally flickering as I type.

The first issue was the graphics card that kept refusing to recognise applications.  I now realise it was the cause of some other issues to do with screen brightness as well. I managed to sort that out by going onto the Intel website and downloading the latest upgrade.
The next thing was that I wanted to use the HMDI port via a projector to screen films. The instruction booklet says it is an micro HMDI so I bought a micro adapter. Wrong! A total waste of money as it is, in fact, a mini HMDI, which I have now purchased as well. I have complained about that and got an apology. It still left me out of pocket.
Using the laptop with a projector is fiddly and there is obviously a knack in the order that the hardware is attached, but thankfully I managed to get it all working. Although the sound quality of the laptop speakers are poor, an external mini speaker works very well and I am sure that with proper speakers either directly attached or via Bluetooth, hopefully, that won"t be an issue. I have not tested all the options out on that.
One of the biggest bugbears I have is the touch pad, which is clunky in the extreme and tends to enlarge or reduce text in an alarming and unexpected way. I have not yet worked out how to avoid that, but when using the laptop at a table I use a mouse and that works fine. On the move the touch pad is adequate. I do hate the clicking noise it makes when pressed, but am learning to live with it.
That is a lot of negatives, but the HD screen is very good, now that the graphics card is sorted and it has wonderful storage extensions. I have an SD card already functioning and intend to add an extra hard drive in due course. I really like the keyboard, which is nice to use and comfortable. The laptop seems quite sturdy and well-built and it is moderately light-weight for its size. So overall I am happy with it, despite the work I have had to pout in to get it up to spec. Of course, the problem with any new laptop is all the updating, the downloading and launching of various programmes. So sending it back after all that is a pain. Even more expensive laptops can have similar issues.
So for the money, I would recommend it. It will make a good travel laptop and one that I can use for screening the film I need to travel with for my work.', '2018-06-05T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '4745', '539') ;

1st the description "mistakes"
I"ve linked their description at this time - Maybe they will try to cover this shady description when they read this review?
They Claim:-
"download and upload speeds are atleast 2x faster than traditional laptops"
This is a completely wrong - the slowest part of the internet is not the home WiFi, but the internet service. Also, I think they are referring to it being compatible with 5ghz WiFi - that"s the frequency of the transmission not the speed. Simply put, 2.4ghz penetrates walls better but 5ghz has greater range in an open area, so you get more choice in which WiFi to use. This has no bearing on your internet speed. 5ghz has been the standard since 2015, so if your laptop is newer than this, it will have the same speed WiFi.
They Claim
"Intel Cherrytrail Quadcore Processor is quick enough to launch your Windows programs with no lag whatsoever and play your favorite games in full speed"
This processor is designed for tablets and notebooks from the start of 2016. It does not play any games in the UK top 10. Lag is a measurement of delay caused by a network, not loading programs - they seem to be using slang that gamers use to try and add some credibility to their system that it does not have.
They Claim
32GB of on-board eMMC storage with the option to expand the memory up to 256GB with a Micro SD card (tf-card) or Insert a HDD (upto 1TB) and increase the internal storage immediately.
The 32GB of storage cannot be expanded. You can add a 2nd drive but you need to use the 32GB as a boot drive. More on this further into my review, as this is the thing that cripples the system.
So, my 3rd point as to why this is only worth 1 star is the fact that the primary HDD is so small, you cannot download updates for Windows 10 as there is not enough space for the downloads, and the version installed is 3 major updates old (about 18 months out of date) - it is from before the "Spectre" and "Meltdown" vulnerabilities were patched out (google this if you want to see how vulnerable this system is to cyber attacks). To try and resolve this I installed a newer version of Windows 10 using a group license from my work. This did not work as the camera, WiFi, Bluetooth, Graphics and Chipset are not supported by Windows 10 by default, as they need drivers from the manufacturer - and no WiFi = no internet to download them. This would only be inconvenient if the drivers were on their website like most manufacturers - there support section of the website has 0 posts! (image of their 0 post support added) After 5 messages to and fro with their "support" they would only give me the install files for the default out of date version of Windows 10 that comes with the system, giving the 2 options of not working correctly, or out of date and potentially vulnerable to attacks.
I purchased this as although I knew the majority of the problems / "alternative facts" of the description, I had hoped I could add a 2.5" hard drive and boot from that, where I would have plenty of space to do the updates. The system is locked down to only boot from the small eMMC Storage Drive (This drive, although a form of solid state is slower than many traditional hard drives)
If they linked the drivers on their web page, they would probably redeem a star or 2, but so far, this system is not worth the money unless you DON"T want internet and only want it for a little light office work, and you are competent enough to put the office program on your system with no CD / DVD drive or Internet.
The above issues are on top of the expected low quality of a budget laptop
The sound is very poor - I feel they have encased the speakers in the plastic moldings - put some speakers in a sealed Tupperware lunch box and you get the idea of how poor this sounds.
The plastic used feels thin and flimsy.

This laptop has a embedded hard drive, which is basically like an SD card but built into the motherboard, this is the only major issue with this laptop as it restricts you to just 32gb of storage, which after just 2 weeks was full up. All we added to the stock install was MS Office Professional. The hard drive capacity I think should be at least 100gb to cope with modern expectations. Thankfully there is the facility to add a second hard drive which can be upto 1tb. The bad thing is, you can"t add the second drive and install windows on that drive as i was advised by the tech support at fusion5 which is disappointing.

Well, if you don"t follow the three album rule then you aren"t a real music fan and if you can"t follow a band as they progress and change then you aren"t a real fan anyway. As someone who grew up loving Radiohead, REM and the Beatles I can only say thank God that Weezer aren"t producing awful baby Pinkertons and what a throroughly enjoyable album this is. After three listens I found myself singing along to every single track and when it was over I was surprised and disappointed. That is the measure of a good album in my book.
Yes, half of Pacific Daydream was kind of empty as the songs just seemed to be lacking heart, but still it contained QB Blitz and Any Friend of Diane"s which are two of their best. This time every song is also very well polished but the songs look back to the black period in Rivers" life after Pinkerton and the production helps to bring out the emotion of the time in a fun uplifting modern way. Singing along to Die You Zombie Bastards is more or less the definition of cathartic music. It is a witty and intelligent looking back to the response to Pinkerton but from a new empire: Rivers is neither losing himself in self-indulgent whining and noise nor is he trying to move on with bland pop music. It is a happy medium which manages to bring up those emotions in a way that is great to listen to. This isn"t Make Believe, this is Byzantine.

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('10279', 'Upon opening the box i found the laptop, charger and some warranty information. First impressions are good, it feels sturdy and while it"s made out of plastic, it is well textured to feel expensive and looks like it could be aluminium from afar.
I specifically chose this device because it"s lightweight (less than 1kg) because i travel a lot and need something that won"t be too heavy, This laptop is just right for the job.
Some of the older chromebooks are limited in how many apps can be installed however some chromebooks (this one included) can also run Linux applications and games. This is currently a beta feature which can be turned on via the settings menu. I turned this on straight away and it allowed me to install some photo editing software and the Open Office suite.
The charger for the new version of this Chromebook is a type USB C which is handy.
The device has two USB C ports, a USB B port, a Micro SD card slot and finally a 3.5mm headphone jack. That"s even better support than a 2018 Macbook Pro. This is really useful because i didn"t need a dongle to connect my camera or phone to the device. The Micro SD card slot is also useful for adding extra storage or connecting your phone"s memory card.
The screen is good for an entry level chromebook. I have no problems viewing text from a distance however the side viewing angles let it down a little bit. But lets be honest, who views the screen from the side very often.
I really like the keypad. It doesn"t feel cheap and the key travel distance is good. The top buttons for sound and brightness are just in the right place. Similarly the  touchpad works well.
The sound is quiet but it doesn"t sound tinny which is nice. However the sound is very clear with earphones in. You can install Spotify and Google play music.
Youtube videos play well. I found that some of the older chromebooks struggled with 1080p video streaming but this seems to handle it fine, even with lots of other tabs open. I assume this is because of the 4gb of memory.
Overall i give this a solid 9/10.', '2018-08-19T17:32:52+01:00', '2', 'false', '4780', '1196') ;

This device is unusable in bright environments or without the night mode and high contrast on. The display on a regular monitor would be bad but on a chromebook that is meant for use outside and in varying conditions, as well as on a go, it"s horrendous.
First of all, viewing angles are maybe 10 degrees left and right and maybe 5 degrees up and down. After an hour I started feeling dizzy because my left and right eye saw different things on the monitor from half a meter away when I wasn"t perfectly centered on it. What"s worse, the distortion is extreme, not only making things harder to read or slightly off-color, but completely invisible under the layer of deep blue or green, dark hues.
Furthermore, the screen is extremely bright with almost no contrast. It"s basically a glorified flashlight that can also display some images. Reading is a chore and frankly impossible for me due to slight issues with sight.
Lastly, I"d like to point out that this is not an anti-glare screen. I honestly feel subjected to false advertising, as this chromebook is basically a mirror. I had to turn off the lights in my room to do anything with it, otherwise I would just mostly see myself. Don"t dream of using it outside, even with maximum brightness. I don"t think I"ve ever seen such a bad display in my life.
On the upside, it seemed to run pretty well. The keyboard is very nice, although it does have an odd layout. The trackpad is bad but perfectly usable. The device looks and feels good as long as you don"t turn it on.

The Chrome system works very well. Potential buyers should be sure they know what a chromebook is and how it differs from a windows computer.

You can also access the google playstore - but be aware that the apps there are designed primarily for android phones/tablets. For example, I use the Zoom meetings platform a lot - and initially downloaded the app from the playstore and was puzzled why it was a cut down version of zoom - eventually realising I needed the zoom web application from the Chrome webstore instead - it then worked perfectly. Chromebooks are not designed to have large offline storage space, but are intended mainly for cloud storage - you get a large amount free. This machine has 32 GB storage, which is reasonable for a chromebook - and in addition you can install a memory card. So far I have made two skype calls on this chromebook, both of which worked well and were of much better quality than on my windows desktop computer. The sound is extremely clear. Like all chromebooks, it starts very quickly. All in all, it is a lovely chromebook - extremely light, good looking, and works well. The screen is adequate, and the brightness can be adjusted.

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('10336', 'I ordered an Acer Chromebook from Amazon because I have an Acer Vista laptop which has worked reliably for many years, illustrated on the left in the picture beside the Acer R11 Chromebook. It is important to appreciate that a Chromebook is considerably smaller than a comparable Windows laptop would be. Although the keyboard is physically smaller, the keys themselves are the same size and you can type quite comfortably.
I got this Chromebook because the Vista operating system is out-of-date for online applications. Getting a Chromebook gets you the latest version of the Chrome browser on a touch screen.
A Chromebook has a keyboard which is more like a typewriter and does not have all those additional keys you get on a Windows keyboard. This makes the Chromebook ideal for writers and journalists - simple and easy to use.  It boots up very quickly and automatically when you open lid. It goes to sleep when you close the lid, but you can explicitly shut it down to conserve the battery, should you intend not to use it for a while.
The Acer R11 Chromebook has a touch screen and can be used as you would use a tablet. If you fold the Chromebook right over, it disables the physical keyboard and a soft keyboard appears on the screen. It is generally quicker to type on the physical keyboard. The fact that it is a touch screen, means you don"t need the clutter of a mouse. You can always use the track pad if you need more accuracy than can be achieved by touch.
You can install Android apps on a Chromebook and use it as you would an Android tablet. You can also install a LInux terminal. However Android and LInux work in the manner of "Virtual Box" to protect Chrome OS from accidental deletion and it is important to understand many Linux and Android apps won"t work because of this.  (If you need a full Linux installation, you would be better off using VNC to another machine. VNC is available as a Chrome extension. You can SSH to a Raspberry Pi and start VNC. You can also VNC to a Windows computer).
A point to remember is that a Chromebook does not run any version of the Windows operating system. This means you cannot install something such as Microsoft Word or any part of the Microsoft Office suite. You can however install a text editor which works offline under Linux. There are facilities within Chrome to edit text files, but these depend on your being within range of WiFi.
The R11 has two USB ports, an HDMI output, a headphone socket and a slot which accepts standard SD cards as used by your camera, so no problem there. You can connect a mouse, if you prefer that.  You can connect your Chromebook to your television using an HDMI lead and show YouTube videos to all the family. Sound quality using the built in speakers is better than a small tablet such as the Kindle Fire would be, but you can connect headphones or a sound system for more serious listening. The built in speakers are good enough for YouTube.
The R11 Chromebook does not have a hard drive or DVD player. It is entirely solid state. There is no fan to cut in and make a noise. Despite being very fast web browsing, it does not get hot while you are using it.
There are more expensive Chromebooks, but if you don"t want to spend any more than this price, look no further!', '2018-12-10T17:32:52+00:00', '1', 'false', '4904', '461') ;

Fantastic for university as it"s able to do all the basic word processing and note taking you could ever need to do, although I probably wouldn"t write an entire essay on it just edit and write a couple hundred words here and there whilst out on campus.

I wasn"t immediately overwhelmed, but it"s certainly growing on me.  Pale Blue Dot is probably the best thing they"ve done since Portnoy left, and one or two of the other tracks are very strong as well.  I don"t particularly like Room 137 and S2N, which sound a bit like fillers to me (maybe the instrumental versions are better?), and although the track At Wits End is mostly very good, I hate that long fade out and the pointless twiddly bit at the end.  They will have to create an ending for playing it live, so why couldn"t they just end it properly in the studio? 
There"s not a great deal of the masterfully dexterous instrumental interplay that we"ve heard on some of the previous albums, just a few quick flurries here and there, but Mike Mangini certainly seems to have finally bedded in and sounds more fluent and much less "stiff" than on the previous albums he"s been on.
Whilst I prefer some of the songs on A Dramatic Turn of Events, that album suffered from a weak drum sound and overall mushy production, and Distance Over Time certainly doesn"t.  Mike Mangini is the best he has ever sounded on a DT album, and the sound overall is crisp, clear, and heavy!  This, however, is Petrucci"s album.  The guitar sounds wonderful throughout and he"s pulled off some of the best solos he"s ever recorded with the band.
I don"t think this will ever go down as DT"s greatest album, as they would have to go some to top Scenes From A Memory or Octavavium, but it"s certainly a big leap back to form.', '2018-10-21T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '4905', '950') ;
INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('10367', 'Distance Over Time is a pretty good album with a heavy, prog sound. No 20 minute epic or running themes here but I can live with it. Vocals are a bit buried in the mix and James voice seems weaker than previous records but superb musicianship all round and killer JP guitar tones. Funny, I didn"t pay as much attention to Jordan as I normally do - I suppose the keyboards arent as half as dominating as with The Astonishing.
On the whole I found the album enjoyable on first play through and warmed to the weaker tracks by the 2nd and 3rd spin. Here’s a short breakdown:
Untethered Angel – A fairly good opener kind of let down by a cheesy, bland chorus which reminded me of Muse (lol!)
Paralysed – I’d say this track is like this albums ‘Forsaken’ or ‘Build me up, Break me down’. It’s good if not a little nu-metally / commercial single sounding? - Wouldn’t be out of place on a James Labrie solo record.
Fall into the light – This one definitely reminds me of something from the first few DT albums. Cool drum rolling into sections and It’s got a great little haunting bit 3:15 in – love the harmonized lead sound which reminds me of something by Metallica or from Train of Thought?
Barstool Warrior – old fashioned 70’s prog affair, a gentler rock track not too over the top.
Room 137 – A simpler song by Dream Theater standards. Heavy with a slower tempo. It kind of feels like a filler track but I suppose it does have a cool 70’s synth vocal thing going for it at one point.
S2n – Again, feels for the most part like filler but the bass is rocking throughout and it"s got a cool, zany section around the 1:50 mark.
At wits end - Good track, starts off like something off 2nd disc of 6th Degrees then into some killer riffage. Again just the chorus lets it down a bit.
Out of reach - Mellowest track on here but I wasn"t as bothered.
Pale blue dot – Heaviest track on the album and has a cracking groove. Probably the best lyrics on the album also – Carl Sagan would be proud.
I am now going to nerd out and list Distance Over Time accordingly in my top 10 DT records. Obviously this will vary from person to person depending on your preferred DT styling… however if you generally agree with my list then you’ll get the idea:

2. Awake (1994)
3. Images and Words (1992)
4. The Astonishing (2016)
5. 6th Degrees of Inner Turbulence (2002)
6. Train of Thought (2003)
7. Octavarium (2005)
8. Distance Over Time (2019)

This is a fantastic and well-made keyboard, I had an old wired dell keyboard which I never had any issues with, but thought it was time for an upgrade as I wanted to reduce the wires on my desk as much as possible
First thing I notice with this new Logitech k270 is how quiet it is compared to my old dell, it’s quite a large difference in the sound, although it’s not a deafening silence, if you’re typing up an assignment etc you can rest assured of not having to be conscious of the sound or disturbing others in a room next door if you have thin walls
The laptop has 8 Hot keys at the top of the keyboard (starting from the left)
1) play/pause
2) Mute
3) volume down
4) volume up
5) home screen (of your default internet browser)
6) email outlook
7) puts your computer in sleep mode
8) calculator
I wanted a keyboard with slightly raised keys as im not a fan of the chiclet keys, but didn"t want to compromise on the old layout that im used to, also to mention the keyboard has a light for caps lock next to the off/on switch and lights up green, unfortunately it does not have a light for “num lock” but when you do press it, a large “num lock on” and “num lock off” sign appear on the screen temporarily to let you know you have activated it
On the back of the keyboard it has feet which can be raised to an 8 degree angle, simple case of just flipping them, there is 4 holes also on the back to help with drainage encase you accidentally spill your drink which is also re-assuring to know – it has a usb storage insert on the back so encase you need to pack the keyboard and take it on your travels but don’t want to leave the usb in your laptop then you can simply pop it in the back where it will be well secured, the usb receiver is tiny anyways so really shouldn"t affect you and can easily be left in your laptop and popped in a laptop bag, keyboard also has 5 rubber bottoms to stop it from slipping on a table and lastly it used 2 AAA batteries (which come supplied with it), manufacturers claim these batteries allow for 24 month batter life, only time will tell

The design is nice and I was quite impressed at first. Of course it had the play/pause button and the calculator button just as I wanted. What could go wrong? Well. I"m typing on it right now and it is SO NOISY. Seriously, the loud clacking is driving me nuts. Secondly, when I run some programs the keyboard just gives up, I can"t use it or type without incredible lag (sometimes it just doesn"t type at all).

There"s a slight difference in the key action, but this K270 has the same dimensions and layout as the K200 that has survived 2 years hard labour in my service, so it has a familiar feel, which is why I went for it.
It"s a fairly quiet (though not silent) keyboard, with enough action for those who have years of experience with the clunking clicketty-clack feel of early keyboards, though with much less height of keystrokes needed, so less tiring.
All the usual keys are there (the Euro shares the 4 / $ key, just press Alt Gr for  instead of Shift for $), plus a row of media keys (play/pause, mute, Vol up & down, browser homepage, email, PC sleep and calculator ... although I only ever use the calculator button).

My previous KB was a Microsoft usb wired unit -one of the "comfort curve" things. It was ok, but like most wired units I use/abuse it developed a wiring fault in the connecting cable. Whilst throwing stuff away offends my sensibilities, green-binning it seemed the only practical course as there didn"t seem to be any simple way of replacing the cable.
I decided to get the Logitech 270.  The long battery life plus on-off switch appealed as did the ~£20 price for something from a reputable manufacturer.
I had a Logitech wireless mouse already -which has proven excellent - and as the keyboard could share the same receiver this  was attractive too(so, I now have a spare receiver!).  Things worked pretty much  straight out of the box, there was nothing to install (in win10).
There are some special function keys which are all pretty obvious as to their purpose -sound on/off/volume and so on. Just be careful with the one that"s labelled PC (with the power symbol).  This shuts your PC down -fairly obviously(?).  Perhaps it"s something specific to my rig but it"s not a graceful shutdown, it seems to be instant - which suggests it could cause some damage to your Windows installation.  However, as I tend not to use these special keys anyway - I tend to forget they are there - its not a problem for me.

My needs for a keyboard were pretty much next to nil; I really was chasing something basic: I wanted a black, normal sized keyboard (not one of those mini-boards that seem to be popular at the moment or any of those nut-job massive gamer keyboards), preferably absent of lots of superfluous feature-buttons and preferably (though hardly compulsory) a wireless capability .
The K270 has proved itself to be perfect for me. The keystrokes aren"t too intrusive (as in they"re nice and quiet) and the fact that it"s wireless turned what was for a me a nice-have option into a must-have feature should I be requiring a new keyboard in the future.
A minor disappointment regarding the wireless feature is it"s range. This keyboard and my PC-tower are all of about a metre apart and yet the keyboard would miss keystrokes and its responsiveness was intermittent; my solution was to insert the dongle into a USB extension cable and drop that behind my monitor; it"s behaved flawlessly ever since.
And about that dongle: It"s a small unassuming little USB gadget that apparently supports several like-minded Logitech devices; my Logitech M705 mouse has one of these as well so I thought that it would have been able to send to the keyboard"s dongle but... it doesn"t.

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('10412', 'I have a netbook which I usually use at a desk by attaching it to a monitor and peripherals to be able to use it as a desktop PC. I previously used a wired keyboard which was a bit of a hassle because it meant yet another wire. So I decided to purchase this wireless keyboard on January 2014 and after more than 2 years (Feb 2016) of extensive use, I believe I have earned the right to write a review for this keyboard.
Price, Delivery & Packaging:
- I paid £17.42 in January 2014.
- From what I can recall the delivery was prompt and the keyboard was safely packaged.
Construction:
- The keyboard is made of plastic and has been made in China.
- It does feel a bit cheap but the quality still seems fine and is good enough to have lasted me over 2 years.
- Approx. dimensions are (L x W x H): 44 x 15 x 2.5 cm
- There are 2 plastic legs on the bottom, which when extended, help raise the level of the keyboard.
- The keys aren"t exactly quiet but are still quieter than other keyboards I have used. The sound created by depressing the keys can be defined as a somewhat muted sound - can be heard but not as loud.
Features:
- There is an on/off button to switch off the device when going away for an extended period of time e.g. on vacation. I have scarcely used the on/off button - perhaps only on a couple of occasions before going on vacation and yet have forgotten to use it before leaving for most vacations.
- The Keyboard automatically goes on standby after a set period of time. I have never bothered using the on/off button for normal everyday without any significant impact to the battery life.
- There is no lag at all whenever use of the keyboard is resumed (e.g. at the beginning of the day). This is contrary to my experience of using wireless mouses which need a click to bring them back from standby mode.
- It comes with a tiny wireless receiver that plugs into any USB slot of the PC (see pics). Mine permanently remains plugged into the USB slot and I have rarely felt the need to remove it. There is a neat little compartment on the bottom of the keyboard into which the wireless receiver can be stored whilst travelling or storing the keyboard (see pics).
- The keyboard is meant to be spill proof, and comes equipped with 4 outlets on the bottom, although I"ve never been in a position to be able to test this feature.
- Operates on 2x AAA batteries
- It has a good selection of hot keys as follows:
1) Play/Pause button
2) Volume mute
3) Volume low
4) Volume high
5) Home
6) Email
7) PC on/off button
8) Calculator
Practicality:
- The keyboard is plug-n-play and should function fine with most PCs. I use a Windows Operating System and was on my way almost as soon as the keyboard was attached.
- It is extremely convenient as it saves me from fumbling around with yet another wire.
- It has great battery consumption. I have not yet had to replace the original set of batteries that were installed upon purchase (which was more than 2 years ago!).
- Good standard size with UK layout
- No issues with the signals at all. We have even used the keyboard in the lounge whilst connecting the netbook with the TV whilst streaming media and it has worked fine at a distance of about 3 meters.
- On a slightly negative note, although the keyboard does have a "Caps Lock" light that illuminates when it is on (see pics), it lacks similar lights for both the "Num Lock" and the "Scroll Lock" buttons which is pretty common on most other keyboards. Not a big issue but if there was any negative point to this keyboard then this would be it.
Conclusion:
It"s a great piece of kit that has already exceeded my expectations, and has survived the odd abuse by my toddler. I use the keyboard on pretty much a daily basis and all keys are still intact and function perfectly. The size is what I would call a bit compact as there isn"t much of a border around the keyboard, but is still the standard size. The size is just about right and is comfortable to use over an extended period of time.
In short, this is a great little piece of kit to use with your PC/netbook/laptop. It comes with a great price and has already lasted me over 2 years and still seems to be going strong. I would not hesitate to buy this again if/when my current keyboard finally does give way. It is by no means a specialist keyboard but I would definitely recommend this keyboard to anyone who is looking to purchase a simple keyboard with modest features without breaking the bank.', '2018-09-07T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '4935', '651') ;

First off, I tried a MS one, which while nice while working kept loosing key presses after going into sleep mode; apparently it wasn"t really compatible with Win 8.1! That was sent back.
This looked like a decent and cheap alternative.
Having been used to the K750, the K270 seems pretty clunky and (obviously, given the cost) less refined. The main problem, as others have said, is the play in the bottom of the keyboard near the space bar, which noticeably flexes and hits the desk while typing. Using the legs to raise back of the KB, or placing some cloth under the front of it seem to partially fix the problem; but neither are really satisfactory solutions. I also tried fixing a small (1mm) bit of rubber to the front middle support; that cured the problem, but introduced another. Namely that the same issue was then apparent at the TOP of the KB, making an even more annoying noise when typing most keys.
The keys themselves also seem rather loose and noisy, although they do seem responsive. It may well be that it"s simply that I"m so used to the more laptop-like action of the K750 that after a while I"ll get used to it.
Overall, I"d still recommend this KB for the price; it"s a very responsive wireless KB at low cost. And from several previous Logitec KBs, I know battery life won"t be a problem.', '2018-05-10T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '4935', '1110') ;

However if you want to use just one "unifying receiver" for more than one product (i.e. the touchpad and keyboard in my case as a single receiver can support 6 devices) then you will need access to a Windows or Mac computer to do the pairing. The software is s small download from Logitech and the process takes only a minute, but there is no Linux option so keep that in mind.

The 3 dpi setting are great and match the cheap gaming mouses, I have gamed once on it when I got it was fine no issues. But if you big into gaming stick with your gaming mouse for gaming and this for other things that what I do.
Battery life is great I get a couple of months using it 8 and half hours 5 day a week. there is an on/off switch on it but I honestly never use it, it powers down after a few min of no use and you just need to click any button to get it going again.

In fact the pointer movement never felt completely smooth, making it hard to be precise. It didn"t matter what DPI I had it set to or what mouse speed I set in Windows. It just didn"t feel right.
The mouse is far too light. I don"t understand the trend with making mice as light as possible - surely with some resistance this allows for finer control?

You"d never think just having your wrists vertical would make such a difference, but it does.
One thing - I"d recommend also getting one of the squishy wrist support pads, otherwise your wrist bones will be resting on the desk, which is not ideal. They"re not very expensive and the two complement each other perfectly. Just getting one of those jelly pads really doesn"t work at all.
For the people who find this harder to get used to than I did (I took to it immediately), you"ll need to challenge your ideas about how a mouse should be. It *does* require more concentration to find it and put your hand around it, but then, hand positioning is half the point of ergonomic design. Take the extra second or so to figure out what you"re doing, it"s worth it. I felt like it was easy to move it - push it gently with an open hand and it glides, no need to grip it hard at all. One of the main problems with trad mice is that you cramp into an unnatural claw position to keep your grip on them.
I will say that I would have preferred a L-ion battery. AAA? Really? In this day and age...? I bought rechargeable AAAs, although that isn"t necessary - the cheapest old batteries from Poundland lasted ages in this mouse.', '2018-07-11T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '4958', '663') ;

I have always worked around computers and never had any issues with my wrists at all. Then I started a new job which was 100% computer work and everything changed.
For me it was also working overtime so I could be doing 10-12 hour days at a computer. My wrist started to feel "weak" and I couldn"t grip things very well - like my steering wheel. It would always feel better at the start of the next day so I didn"t think much of it. Then it stopped feeling better and I constantly had a weak, numbing feeling in my hand and wrist. I was starting to overcompensate with my left hand, it was badly affecting my everyday life.
So I googled and found out about the vertical mouse. Quick look on Amazon and this one came up as a sponsored link, but due to the low price and excellent reviews I bought it. Next day delivery, on a Sunday too.
I"ve been using this for a month now but I can honestly say I felt the difference the very first day. It takes a few minutes to get used to holding it but now it"s second nature. Before trying this I was extremely stressed trying to work though the pain. I had got to the point where I was crying on the drive home thinking I would have to leave a job I loved because I was losing feeling in my hand.
I would advise that you buy one of these regardless of if you have wrist issues - why wait until you"re in pain. All I can say is for the price what have you got to lose?', '2018-05-13T17:32:52+01:00', '0', 'false', '4958', '337') ;

Overall -since the start of using this mouse I developed more pain in my wrist and thumb (the pain was the reason for buying it).
It is not clear to me on what basis they allow to say that the mouse is "ergonomic". It is not.

With a price of below 20 € we cannot expect a product that can deliver everything. However there are some elements that I am disappointed about. Regardless of that, I"d happily buy this again to give it a go.
Let"s start with the good things:
- Surprisingly comfortable even with a big hand, but cutting it close
- Nice feeling textures. Doesn"t feel cheap or plasticy
- Good durability despite the low cost
- Button Locations (including back buttons) are comfortable and easy to reach
- Allows for DPI Switching (more below)
- Wireless
Cons. And this is where you need to make the decision for yourself whenever or not this is a deal breaker for you
- The Optical Sensor is questionable. With various surfaces, or even a grainy gaming-style mousepad, it has noticeable issues to pick up and a stutter is the consequence. Even on smooth surfaces and "standard" mouse pads it didn"t pick up as fluidenly as I"d expect for a mouse in the modern age. The issue persisted regardless of DPI Setting.
- No onboard memory. DPI Settings are stored on your Computer. While you can change the DPI Settings, you can only do that once the USB Dongle is in the PC, and the Mouse is properly recognized. Pressing the DPI Switcher Button without that will just default you to the default setting. This is a potential issue for any locked (work) devices that do not allow for dongle installations
- No charging possibilities. 2 AAA Batteries are needed. If this is a pro or con for you I"ll let you decide, for me it"s a definite con.
- To pick up from my Pro List. While I have big hands, they do fit into the mouse. But barely. Any non perfect positioning and I am sliding over the surface. With a bit more training I"m sure I"ll just get used to that, but a larger size would be appreciated.', '2018-08-17T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '4958', '578') ;

However, it"s not perfect and could be greatly improved. Firstly, the finish isn"t quite grippy enough which means you have to properly hang on the mouse when lifting it to reposition. Secondly, the force needed to activate the main two buttons is a little too high. Whereas on a normal mouse you"re effectively pressing the button down into the desk, with this one you need to grip it between your index finger and thumb when clicking, which introduces another new ache at the base of the thumb. Maybe this will ease with time and use. Thirdly, the range isn"t great. I tried it out at home first where my PC is on the desk about half a meter away. The mouse was choppy and unresponsive. Mercifully it works ok at work where the PC is under the desk directly below the mouse pad.
Overall then, while it certainly helps for its intended purpose (strain relief) it does have a few other inherent problems. For the money though I"d say it still worth a try to see how you get on with it.', '2018-11-02T17:32:52+00:00', '0', 'false', '4958', '295') ;

Pros- It"s quite big (although still not quite big enough for my freakish hands). Left and right mouse clicks are good, Solid build. Accurate tracking. Doesn"t need a mouse mat.
Cons.- I don"t like the vertical position. You feel like you"re holding the mouse "in" your hand, rather than resting your hand "on" the mouse. For me this makes using the mouse for long periods more tiring than a regular mouse. This problem is exacerbated when pressing the mouse buttons; Because the mouse isn"t lying flat on the desk, in order to "press" a button, your finger has to apply lateral force, which moves the mouse sideways. To counteract this your thumb has to provide an opposite force on the other side of the mouse. The upshot of this is that, in order to press any of the buttons, you essentially have to "squeeze" the mouse between your thumb and fingers, which is a lot more effort than pressing down on a traditional mouse button with your finger. (Particularly the middle mouse button which is pretty stiff)
I think this mouse might be of use for someone who doesn"t actually use the mouse all that much. If your primary application is "Microsoft Office" or similar, where you mostly use keyboard, then it might be good for you. But I"m a CG Animator, so I use the mouse a lot (particularly the middle mouse button for Maya navigation), so the extra effort required to press the buttons and the instability caused by the sideways force on the buttons makes the vertical mouse design fundamentally unsuitable for my needs

As such I couldn"t use the normal Cherry switches unless I used a non backlit keyboard which in my office would have meant some kind of overhead lighting which I didn"t really want.
Now I"ve got this keyboard, I wouldn"t go back to cherry keys. Not only are these keys quieter than my old MX Browns but they also don"t suffer with as much wobble which means I can type quicker and be more sure I"m pressing the right keys.
I"ve used this keyboard for writing English and programming in SQL and it does the job excellently. I also game using it both FPS and RTS (not sure which World of Warships comes under but that as well). In game the keys are admirable and despite running them through a USB switch (effectively a KVM switch) I"ve noticed no input lag nor have I found issues using the keyboard. The software which goes with the keyboard Logitech G Hub does sometimes fail to recognise I"ve started a game and doesn"t switch profiles but a quick Alt+Tab to the desktop or another app and then back in again and it works fine. Other than that the level of control is excellent and the layout is about as non technical as you can expect with all of these features.
Now down to the pretty bit, the RGB.
Yes these aren"t the brightest of lights. There"s no spill and it won"t light up a room but I like that. What is does do is light each key"s characters evenly and in whatever colour you so choose (except white of course which is blueish on almost all RGB keyboards) and the effects you can program are wonderful. It"s a real nice feature to mirror your desktop colours in the keyboard (yes it really does look cool and quite understated in my opinion) and if you want to have a ripple effect then I was shocked how well that worked.

Good lighting, not amazingly bright but well lit and with great effects.

The keyboard has mechanical switches giving a feedback tactile click when pressed, it also means you can pound the keys during gaming joy, if that is your thing.

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('10485', 'The carbon is a heavy, metal-faced, robust-feeling keyboard built with gaming in mind, but also suitable for other tasks. The weight, together with good rubber feet, makes it steady as a a rock. The tactile keys are proper mechanical keys with a good travel and a loud clackety-sound. The keys are surface-mounted, meaning that their entire travel is above the plane of the keyboard surface, with an underhang visible. There’s a USB pass-through port on the right end of the rear panel, and there’s a tripod-style screw fixing on the back, so the keyboard could presumably be suspended in mid-air, given a suitable mounting bracket. I can imagine it being used in game demo booths in shops and at conventions. Note that to use the USB_pass-through, the keyboard needs two USB ports on your PC; otherwise, you only need one, but are left with a dangling plug.
Other than the LED lighting, there are no bells and whistles, no extra keys or mini-display windows. It’s just a good, no-nonsense heard-wearing, responsive keyboard. A keyboard for serious gaming, in fact. There is one very slight design defect: the front corner of the spacebar is quite sharp, and as that’s the bit I press, it is a little uncomfortable when typing. But of course, this keyboard is really meant for gaming. The size of the keyboard is just about perfect: it’s a full-size keyboard, but with only about 10 mm of space round the outer edges of the keyboard: there’s no wasted space, so it doesn’t take up any more room than it needs to. I don"t use the supplied palm rest.
There’s a key-removal tool and some alternate keys provided for the main movement keys. These keys have a different profile, so you can find them easily by touch. Not recommended if you’ll also by typing on the same keyboard.
The software, which you must download, will detect your installed games, but you can add more manually. It knows the standard keyboard layout for many games, but it also supports macros and all sorts of other options. The profile editor is called “Customise G-Keys”. Choose or add a profile from the top, then if you want to record a macro or assign a new key press the “+” in the Commands window. You can set up hotkeys including (controversially) Alt-F4 for those times you may want to quit your game in a hurry.
If you want the profile to switch automatically when you start a game, you need to tell the Logitech software what executable to monitor. Within the profile editor (”Customise G-Keys”) click on the little down-arrow on the profile you want to associate, choose “Properties” and “+”. You can then navigate to the game executable and add it. The keyboard will now automatically change profile - and lighting - when you launch and exit your game.
There are loads of lighting settings, many of them more decorative than useful: I’m not sure I want coruscating fire under my fingers as I try to play a game. The useful options are to set a fixed colour for all the keys; “Zones”, which highlights blocks of keys (for example W,A,S,D, number keys, function keys and the arrow keys) in different colours; and (best of all) “Freestyle”, which allows you to set a colour for every key individually. For a game like Frontier Developments’ Elite: Dangerous, which has an awful lot of keys to remember, having all the keys lit up in blocks of colour (main engine thrust one colour, manoeuvring thrusters a different colour, targeting keys another colour again - see the picture) is extremely useful. You can turn off the lights altogether for keys you don’t use; the key effectively turns black, so you only see the keys you need.
You can also toggle the keyboard into game mode (there’s an LED to show when you’re in this mode), and you can customise what keys will be disabled (the Windows key and the Context menu buttons are disabled by default in game mode).
If for any reason you want to tell what keys you’re pressing frequently - and this can be useful if you want to find out what customisations, colours and macros you may want to set - there’s a utility in the software for that too.

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('10486', 'I can remember using the old Cherry keyboards that came with older PCs, there was a time they were the only ones you could get. Then lighter, slimmer, quieter keyboards came along (probably due to the evolving technology in laptops), then the PS/2 port (is a 6-pin mini-DIN connector) gave way to USB and then wireless options using wifi and bluetooth. The Cherry keyboards still had a cult following, they never really went away
This keyboard uses Logitech"s custom design Romer-G linear switches, and are the equivalent to the Cherry MX Brown. These are a compromise over gaming and general typing. Also, as they"re not the same as the (universal) Cherry series, finding different key caps is pretty much off the board, however replacement keys are more the lookout for enthusiasts, not casual gamers.
Smart looking box that as soon as you pick it up you realise it"s heavy, over well a kilogram! The full size keyboard is separate from the wrist rest and you see the base is one solid piece of brushed black aircraft grade aluminum-magnesium alloy.  Very nice. Connection is by a very thick and not very flexible double USB cable and there"s a USB 2.0 pass through socket on the back right (for wired/wireless dongle mouse or memory stick, etc). Note you only need to connect one of the USB cables to power the G513, it"s the one with the handy little keyboard icon on the USB connector. There"s also a strange 1/4" screw thread on the back (that no one knows what it could be for as yet).
Included in the box are a selection of replacement with 12 replacement keys: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Q, W E, R, A, S, D and a plastic keycap remover. These are the standard gaming keys and the alternatives are a different shape so you can find them without needing to look (and getting fragged in the process). There aren"t any dedicated programmable buttons and no dedicated media buttons either (though they are integrated into the function keys), so that could be a deal breaker for some.
The lighting is on another level. The LEDs are at the bottom of what they call a light pipe and I prefer that to the "floating key" / exposed switch design, I don"t need the ambient glow around the keys no matter how cool it looks. There"s no LED no bleed through, the whole key is lit evenly so you see the letters/numbers/characters perfectly clearly. That includes those secondary characters on the front of the key.  The keys are bright and the colours are vivid.
The palm rest is separate, so you can choose to use it or not. It"s made of leatherette and memory foam and I found it the right height for the keyboard. It"s also meant to be water and sweat proof. There"s no way of hooking it up to the keyboard though, but its six rubber feet stop it from moving about and you can position it just where you want.
It"s not a quiet keyboard, typing late at night you"re aware that it can be heard all through the house.  I am going to buy these o rings:
https://www.amazon.co.uk/Keyboard-Dampeners-Plastic-Storage-Mechanical/dp/B0761TSWF3/
As they should dampen the noise by over half and because they"re translucent, they shouldn"t affect the colours of the keys.  I"m nowhere near a hardcore gamer, so any micro-second lag is not going to make any difference to me (fragged again, lolz)
The downloadable and comprehensive Logitech gaming software controls all aspects of colour and animation and create proifles, though if you don"t want to do that, function keys F5 to F8 provide some controls as well.

That said, Corsair"s CUE software took quite some getting used to but having reinstalled the Logitech Gaming Software I"m actually missing the Corsair product. Both sets of software are horribly unintuitive but the CUE software allows control over pretty much everything and even allows you to set up macros which include mouse clicks and positioning. The Logitech Gaming Software only allows for limited mouse controls, basically button presses and scrolling.
The wrist rest is superb. Very comfortable. In fact it"s the sort you would be prepared to pay extra for and is much better than the plastic rests which come with even the most premium of other gaming keyboards - those other manufacturers need to be looking at this.
I"ve been typing for over forty years and I"m  still very much a four fingers and two thumbs guy. I can touch type adequately if I don"t think about it but I still like to check the keyboard every so often. Pitiful I know but I"m sure I"m not alone. Unlit the keytops on the Logitech G513 are useless. You need to tilt your head back to a certain angle just to make them out. It doesn"t help that many of the default lighting profiles leave the majority of the keys unlit.
By default the FN-F7 key lets you cycle through several brightness options for the LEDs. I don"t see a way to set brightness from within the software, so you can"t eg have your WASD keys fully bright with the other keys dimmed somewhat. I"m not saying it isn"t possible, I just can"t see how to do it.
Comes with replacement keycaps for the QWERTY and 12345 keys AND includes a key puller which is very easy to use.
The default lighting setting is quite annoying, making it pretty much essential to install the LGS software.
Really excellent keyboard let down by sub-par software, although to be fair I think the LGS software is basically dumbed down so as not to confuse users. While functionally much worse to use, the CUE software gives you much more control - if only it didn"t forget my profiles every so often.
Unequivocally, if you"re not going to be dabbling with macros, I wouldn"t hesitate to recommend this.', '2018-08-18T17:32:52+01:00', '1', 'false', '4971', '467') ;

I guess keyboards are a personal thing and you need to try before you buy.  The keys are deep and draw your fingers in, perfect for gaming, which is the principle target audience for this device, although it is also very good for typing, work etc
The keyboard comes with several lighting functions, and you can"t see the keys unless the lights are on.  I found the streaming through the colours of the rainbow version a bit much, and there is plenty of lighting power, to the extent that it was too bright.  However, there are so many key lighting functions and you can find one you like.  I am particular taken by the one that gives a ray of colour every time you press a key, but more often than not , I simply had etc muted cyan on.
The keyboard comes with a memory foam wrist rest, which is very welcome and makes the whole thing a pleasure to use.  My only niggle with this, is that the keyboard features a usb lead through, but you have to plug a second usb connection to make it work.  Not really much use for that.

The profile is 132mm x 455mm x 34mm , for me with limited desk space is ideal. The keys feature responsive switches giving quiet tactile keys, raised keys makes a much nicer / comfortable keyboard to use. Lack of dedicated multimedia keys at this price is an omission (rather than a fn + F keys). An integrated USB pass through allows connection of USB devices or for charging purposes.
The Logitech gaming software, allows adjustment of the RGB illumination, reprogram function keys, create profiles for different games. Not all keys can  reprogram every key but the program is intuitive to use.
The real test of a gaming keyboard is how it performs during a gaming session. My games of choice for the testing was Call Of Duty WWII and GTA V. The keyboard is responsive, accurate and comfortable making it a pleasure for gaming. Illumination helps in the dark allowing quick and easy location of keys even in total darkness.
Overall
Very well designed, solid well built and responsive keyboard with RGB illuminated back lighting with stunning metal carbon looks. The slim profile makes gives this keyboard a mean minimalistic but functional look. The excellent Logitech software allows customisation of the keyboard options makes this keyboard an excellent gaming keyboard choice.

The keyboards are well made and look gorgeous.  The aluminium finish on top looks great.  The wrist rest is a very pleasing memory foam and a joy to use.
Its well made and the keys look great.  They sport full rgb colour too.  A svelte design it makes great use of space and retains a minimalist design.
The layout is great, but I miss dedicated media keys such as volume up and down and I think that is a bit of an omission.  But whilst there are no dedicated keys you can map secondary function keys through the software.
The WASD keys and 1-5 keys can be replaced with the included caps which have a deeper surface that I found great for games, preventing my fingers straying off.
The Logitech software is mature and a good to use.  As opposed the horrendous mess from Corsair (Cue) software.
The keyboard, like other rgb ones needs two usb ports to draw enough power but there is a usb pass through included.

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('10494', 'Summary: this keyboard is very good for both gaming and typing. The Romer-G Tactile switches are quiet and each keystroke is consistent. The font is very friendly to read. Software is easy to use and very functional. USB passthrough is a nice addition. However, there are some minor "quality of life" issues due to the design. The previous issues (which were minor to the G810) were present in this model of the keyboard but some were rectified. Also Romer-G Tactile OR Linear might not suit everyone"s taste. Overall a very solid keyboard.
Intro: I got this keyboard just for the sake of upgrading to a newer Logitech keyboard, so I settled on the G513 Tactile. Needless to say I was just as impressed with this as with my previous G810 Orion Spectrum.
The key switch: To be clear, Romer-G is Logitech"s in-house switch type thats meant to rival the likes of Cherry, Razer, Gateron etc. . I went for the Romer-G Tactile which are like Cherry MX Browns in a way, plus I already used the exact same switches on the G810.
Design: I adorn the floating keycap design which other mechanical keyboards have, as this makes it even easier to clean. The keyboard uses a metal backplate and the top plate is also metal which adds rigidity and weight to the keyboard. The overall design of the keyboard is far from the aggressive "gamer" look, as this product looks very elegant and modern; turn off the RGB and it fits perfectly in an office environment. Like pretty much all of Logitech"s recent gaming keyboards, the RGB comes through the keys itself rather than the light "spilling" underneath the keycaps. A soft leather/pleather? wrist rest is included and it is very plush for those who would like to use it.
Functionality: its a keyboard with some extra features and RGB lighting to put it quite simply. The extra keyboard functions like media controls are embedded to the F keys above (toggled by an FN key). Making use of the Logitech Gaming Software (LGS), you can fully customise the lighting effects, set macros and even choose which keys are disabled when "Game Mode" is activated. This keyboard also comes with a USB passthrough port (thus the keyboard has 2 USBs to plug in) which allows you to plug in any USB device; in my case I plugged my mouse.
Positives: On the G810 and G910, the bottom of the keystrokes were quite mushy, almost akin to a membrane keyboard; this is 95% rectified on the G513. The font is easy to read and doesnt look gamery at all. The overall footprint is small for a full size keyboard. USB passthrough is very useful to avoid the need to reach the back of your PC to plug a USB device (though this feature should be standard at all price points)
Negatives: The metallic sound when typing still remains with this keyboard, I already got used to this fact but some of you may dislike the keyboard for this very purpose. "Normal" keyboards have a SCROLL NUM CAPS light, but this only has Game Mode and CAPS lock lights; a prompt on screen tells you when NUM or SCROLL is active. This will definitely annoy more people since you wont be able to know if its active.
Conclusion: the G513 is a well build keyboard from Logitech and if you are already familiar with the Romer-G keys, then youll feel right at home. I understand that not everyone will like certain aspects of the product. Luckily the consumers still have plenty of choices at this relatively high price point.

Very lightweight but doesn"t fee tool flimsy. The rubber feet are just enough to stop it sliding around and the cable is not excessively long. Perfect for me to use around the house and it often comes to and from work in my bag.

Navigating Win 10 I hated from the first minute. When your doing something important the update kicks in keeping you from finishing your task. So I decided to return that laptop and order the Asus Chromebook.
It is beautifully designed, nice to look at and feel. It is light, very fast and handles at least 18 different websites opened without lagging. Display is crisp, colours not overwhelmingly candylike;) The lit keyboard is perfect and so are the keys in general.  I have switched to Beta version (beta chanel) and can use Google Playstore and all the  apps. It was so easy to switch: just google: how to switch chromebook from stable chanel to beta. Voila, a few clicks and you re done. From A to Z , from design to performance and all that comes with them: highly recommended. It is so worth the price. No regrets, I just love love love it. However, if you want to purchase a Chromebook please check beforehand if your printer is  eprint or cloud print ready. Mine is and it was easy to connect both via same Wifi . Also: if you think you cannot live without Microsoft Office, you might want to watch a few videos on Youtube first. I don t miss Office at all. There is an online office version and google docs on a chromebook. Easy to use, all good .
Update: I m still happy after intensive use. The only tiny  con is: the outside looks so gorgeous in brushed silver but shows many fingerprints in no time', '2018-12-27T17:32:52+00:00', '2', 'false', '775', '952') ;

I use Evernote on a daily basis but compared to the full program the Android App is very limited, while the web version, though better is still frustrating.
Similarly with email - I"ve never liked the web version of Gmail (has it changed in 10 years?) and I couldn"t find anything I liked much better.

Great machine, really nice design (metal construction, backlit keyboard etc). Now that you can use Android apps it may well be all you need - can now use Microsoft Office if needed, download videos from iPlayer/Netflix etc, play games. It also finally gives some purpose to having a touchscreen.
The 360 hinge is also really useful, can use it as a stand to watch something on the train/in bed. To me it"s essentially a laptop that you can use as a tablet (rather than the other way round as you might say an iPad pro or something is).
Battery life is good, I"ve generally got 8-10 hours per charge.
Personally, I really like Chrome operating system as everything backs up automatically, you don"t need software or anti virus and it doesn"t slow down in the way I"ve found Windows machines have in the past (my old Chromebook is 6 years old (has been commandeered by my girlfriend), is still going strong and initially cost £200).

The mousepad is fine with different finger gestures achieving various things. It has a good battery life and charges very quickly.
Obviously, there is no disk drive and the physical memory of the device is limited. This is completely redeemed by the 100gb of free google drive space; allowing all of your files to be saved in the cloud instantaneously. Google Docs is a perfect alternative to Microsoft Office, with a clear user interface and the added bonus of being able to share files with others instantly. You have to use a USB adapter because the USB 3.1 Type-C ports are a different shape and size than the usual USB ports that most people are familiar with. You need a Google account for this device but this can be set up when you first turn it on. Chrome OS is easy to use and seemingly well-designed. One or two apps didn"t seem to work that well (Spotify) so I used the website version instead. The apps make it seem more like a tablet than a PC at times but that"s not always a bad thing: some apps integrate the touchscreen very nicely.
This Chromebook is well worth the price for what it gives you and I very much recommend it. I"ve been using it for about a month now and there have been no issues that couldn"t be solved with a bit of computer know-how.

The shape is great and easy to grip though people with larger hands might find it a little small for me with medium sized hands I find its great for palm grip.
The battery life is awesome I"ve still not had to change an AA but 30 days of average use is each achieved and I wouldn"t expect anything less than 2 weeks if not more if you use it all day for gaming.

The G305 uses the same shell as these the only difference I can see is a slightly smaller dpi button.
The G pro uses a variant of the Avago 3360 sensor which is the best on the market at present. The G305 uses the new HERO sensor and as far as I can tell it performs the same. I have always avoided wireless mice due to two issues. Firstly they can suffer from lag and secondly the batteries make them too heavy for gaming - I like light mice. After playing with this mouse I can find no lag - the mouse seems just as responsive as my G Pro. This is due to the Lightspeed technology Logitech has been developing the last few years.
As regards the weight this is where the new HERO sensor comes in. Although it performs like a 3360 it is much more power efficient. This means powering it with replaceable AA batteries becomes feasible. Logitech say one AA battery lasts about 250 hours. However this is in gaming mode. If you set it to low power for desktop use it will last for nine months says Logitech.
The mouse is designed for an AA battery and comes with a Duracell. However Energiser Lithiums are lighter and last longer. I"ve gone one step further and use a AAA Energiser Lithium in a AAA to AA converter. This keeps the weight down to about 85g same as the G Pro and also improves the balance slightly.
The mouse uses the Logitech software suite which I think is the best there is. I set my dpi etc then switch it to "onboard mode" so the internal memory retains the settings. The receiver is a small USB dongle. Mine is plugged in fairly close to the mouse and as I said I have no issues with lag or latency. However Logitech also provide an extension lead if you need to get the receiver closer to the mouse.
The buttons feel the same as the G Pro. Left and right main buttons use Logitech"s spring tensioning system which results in fast, light clicks. Side buttons are fine and the scroll wheel has a fairly strong click.
In summary this is a breakthrough product in my opinion. It performs like a wired mouse and weighs the same. However it has the convenience of not needing an annoying cable which keeps snagging on the pad or desk. I think the price is ridiculous - I think the mouse would still be good value at double the price. The only downside is the lack of bling. There are no RGB lights on this to save battery life and keep the weight down. For serious gamers like me this doesn"t matter.

The build quality seems decent. I had read that the mouse wheel felt cheap prior to purchasing this, however it feels as good as any other mouse I have used before. Most of the buttons feel good on the mouse, however the side buttons on it are quite small and less tactile than I would have liked (from someone used to larger side buttons).
My previous mouse was the death adder which is considered quite a large mouse, so moving to this considerably smaller mouse was strange at first , but quickly got used to it.
The wireless function is excellent, 1ms delay is not noticeable and even when on endurance mode the increased delay is very quickly gotten used to.
The battery life is around 10 days on high performance which is good, but for me I cycle between high performance, endurance and off when I"m gaming, using it for productivity or not using it. This will increase it battery life even further.
The software is a little bit buggy but usable.
Overall excellent mouse, highly recommended. But, if you want something slightly larger, but also runs on batteries (therefore having a much longer battery life than most wireless mice), has larger side buttons...

If you are buying them just for listening then they are lovely and won"t expose you to the brutal clarity that many of the reference headphones go for whilst still being very clear and with excellent spacial visualisation. As I said for the money you aren"t going to get better just different.', '2019-01-22T17:32:52+00:00', '0', 'false', '952', '392') ;

No EQ. No burn in and Exquisite sound straight out of the box. These weigh almost nothing so are incredibly light and comfortable. They may not be able to take a beating but they"re not designed for that so I don"t understand some of the online negativity surrounding the build quality. Super light is to be commended in my book. I like luxurious materials as much as the next caveman but not everything needs to be made out of grass fed calfskin leather and graphine!
Having never used Audio Technicas paddle headband system I was pleasantly surprised and combined with the lightweight design they seem to float next to your ears. They come with no accessories other than a pointless bag and the retail packaging cardboard box they arrive in. So whilst certainly not the last word in comfort or luxury by any means, they work for me and id rather they put the money in the sound.
Which is where these shine. Sound signature? Neutral neutral neutral. Accurate accurate accurate. But with an added bonus of a seriously well defined bass. Not Philips Fidelio X2 bass (but that was always too much for these ears) but an accurate well defined bass with great texture.
Having recently had some experience with the closed bass monsters that are the Beyer DT1770 and DT150 these R70x"s were like a light refreshing shower compared to the muggy humidity of the Beyers. And a welcome audio "shower" they are too.
Think Beyer DT880 neutrality but with less sibilant treble and a better well defined bass. And also these don"t sound half as thin as the Beyers.
Think also an open spacious Oppo PM3 with a more present treble - to my ears at least!
And don"t be put off by the impedance. I was worried my rig wouldn"t be able to handle the 470 ohm but these seem to require less power than the 250 ohm DT1770 and DT150 so they must be an "efficient" 470 ohm! If there is such a thing!
I ran them out of my Littledot II MKII tube amp and also on high gain on my Fiio A3 (E11) and ditto on my Fiio E12A and they were had more than enough juice across the board.
Don"t expect the usual Audio Technica MSR7/M50X sound signature and you may be in for a surprise. These are real reference quality neutrality at a reasonable price.
Hope some of this helps.

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('10896', 'If you are spending this sort of money on open-back headphones you are entitled to expect a spacious, detailed and revealing sound and this is delivered brilliantly by the Audio Technica R70x. I agree completely with the comprehensive reviews written by Stew Tyrrell and T White on these pages, who describe with aplomb how good these headphones sound so I won’t go on too much myself, but I have to mention the bass which is particularly satisfying and well-defined. Far superior in my opinion to the similarly-priced rival AKG K712.  The R70x are not bass monsters, though. They are superbly engaging and satisfying neutral headphones which neither over nor under-emphasise any part of the sound spectrum.
The light weight (approx 210g) of these phones is amazing and the wing/paddle system also works very well to make the cans really comfortable. I have an unusually narrow head and often have the opposite problem to some people in that conventional headbands don’t come in far enough for me, but Audio Technica’s system here handled my strange noggin with no problems!
I am also a glasses wearer and often find over-ear headphones to be uncomfortable whilst wearing glasses. I think I am fussier than most; ultimately I just can’t stand the feel of the earpad pressing against the arm of my glasses but the beauty of these cans is that the earcups are relatively small for an over-ear design so I find I can tilt my glasses out of the way whilst wearing them. The earpad cushioning is soft, though, so if you wear glasses and are not as fussy as me you will probably get on fine with just putting them on as normal. The clamp force is certainly not excessive, but it is also easy to relieve by gently bending the metal headband frame. I would say my ears are average size and they fit snug inside the cup, so if you have larger ears the R70x may not work for you in that respect.
Other issues with the R70x that have been commented on: Yes, the cable is long at 3m and Audio Technica ought to have included a shorter alternative, but it is thick and does not tangle easily. It terminates in a 3.5mm jack with a screw-on 6.3mm adaptor which is the way I wish all headphone cables were set up.
I didn’t find the L and R markings difficult to spot inside the headband and in any case my pair has the country of manufacture sticker (Taiwan) on the inside left so I can easily identify the correct way to wear them. And yes, when you first put the cables in it doesn’t matter which plug you use!
The impedence is high at 470 ohms but the cans are not ridiculously difficult to drive. They are obviously not intended for portable use, but out of interest I tried them plugged in directly to my iPod and phone (Samsung A3) and both were able to achieve an adequate volume level. However, the difference when I used my iPod with my Fiio E12A headphone amp was significant; they really opened up and showed a fuller dynamic range. An even better result was achieved using an RCA phono to 3.5mm cable direct from my Arcam CD player into the Fiio E12A which made the cans absolutely shine.  This is now my regular home listening set-up until I can afford an Arcam rHead!  On the basis of these experiments I think you will need a headphone amp to get the very best out of the R70xs.
Having tried quite a few headphones for home hi-fi listening recently these are absolute winners in this price bracket and are an easy five stars.', '2018-07-04T17:32:52+01:00', '0', 'false', '952', '619') ;

And quite to my surprise it ended up dethroning the HD650 from the top of my list. It resisted the attack of the Elear and Nighthawk but this time it had fallen. The Elear are brutally heavy which is a pity as I could not stand them even though they reproduced piano even better than my HD800. What a shame. These R70x are light as a feather and the flip side of the coin is that when you unbox them they seem no better than a 15£ pair of cans sold at Walmart. But when your ears take over your eyes and tactile feelings the magic starts. It took me perhaps a whole month to decide to keep them and sell the HD650, while the HD600 are going to stay. The R70x have in my opinion a slightly less precise mid register but they excel in both mid-bass and sub-bass. The high register is very inoffensive but not veiled. When I swith from the HD800 I do not find the R70x veiled, just another flavour of music reproduction which is very suitable for late night listening and non-analytical sessions during day time, when music is not the sole focus of your mind. This of course is just my opinion and others may prefer the HD650.

Having read a number of articles however, all of which state in no uncertain terms that mixing should really be best carried out via monitors but if you really have to do it on headphones then it should be on open backed ones as the sound quality and results are always better than with closed back, I thought I"d give it a try, but to my horror when I plugged these headphones into the back of my Mac the sound quality had immediately deteriorated drastically along with the level  (I know these have high resistance but this drop was ridiculous)  I had the mac volume full up but despite this there was almost zero output and I honestly couldn"t believe what I was hearing. Initially I thought that my mixes with the closed back model must really be so bad that they were being shown up in such a bad light. But no, my reference tracks were also suffering in the same way and had gone from loud and crystal clear to quiet and muddy - like listening with cotton wool in your ears.

In short ice clear sound is what you will get with these R70X. I must apologise to you now, because please forgive the excitement which is to follow, as I can only say, once you own a pair, within minutes, you too, will surely understand every single word of my review to follow these words. There"s none of that "burning in" befuddlement either - these astound from momento uno. Period. What"s more, no matter what genre of music you find yourself playing, you"ll also find that every instrument occupies its own distinctly translucent audio space - without needing to borrow any "soundstage" from any other instrument. The balance between instruments is a technological marvel in itself. How on earth did Audio Technica manage to breath so much magic into one pair of headphones. And did I mention the clarity? Exxxxpletive yeah...The Clarity!!!! It"s no understatement to say that their clarity is not of this world: The bass, the mids, the treble, no matter how many headphones I"ve tested in my time, nothing delivers sound as faultlessly as these headphones.
Welcome to headphones which are quite undoubtedly the world"s most excitingly neutral headphones - & that would be true at even double their price. Their sound quality is, and I cannot stress this enough, not of this world. Now I know why it"s so extremely hard, for other reviewers to find a negative word about these R70X. Actually, on that note, I see that some have criticised them for the fact that their wires aren"t clearly labelled "left" or "right" without realising that Audio Technica have breathed magic into that aspect too - for it truly doesn"t matter which side you plug the wires into (and I don"t know about you, but I always prefer detachable wires anyway) you will *still* experience left on the left hand side and vice versa. Furthermore, I see that they fit comfortably on people with all kinds of head size, and I might add too that even on my extra large sized head, they fit perfectly too - being so light, you"d hardly notice they"re there; and some of you might rightly even wonder whether they"re in the box, you"ll receive, at all.
Back to the sound quality: The extraordinary balance between the bass, the mids and the treble, simply has to be heard to be believed. Yes, some headphones are a little bassy, some a bit "trebley", others have "recessed mids" yet are otherwise good at the highs and lows;  And so on and so forth; But these R70X just have to be heard to be believed. For instance, I own the M50s and they are nothing like as perfect as these phones, great as they are in their own right.
Trying to find headphones which deliver a better sound than these give,  and so I will buy another pair as soon as I can afford to do so. I"ve written over 150 reviews here on Amazon, and never have I liked a product so much, that I can confidently say that to buy these once isn"t enough. Seldom do I get so excited about a product that I haven"t a single reservation about it  ...until now. You will probably need a pair of these and onlistening to their magic, I won"t be the only one who"ll quest for a backup pair, especially for when your friends nick "em from you, after they claim to just (ahem) "borrow them" to try them out with their own collection.  They too will fall hopelessly entranced with their perfectly balanced sonic clarity.
I tested them with both hifi equipment, a Boss BR800 mixer, an Elektron Octatrack and the three portable players which follow, and in no way were they anything less than perfect no matter what device I put in their direction.
Indeed, I have also tried these phones with a Fiio X3, a Hi-dizs AP100 and a Sandisk Clip+, and here are my findings. With the Fiio X3, they are far too quiet on "low" gain setting. When "High gain" setting is enabled in settings, I can listen to any music very loud, and would not wish the sound to be louder. The same goes for the Hi-Dizs AP100 which if anything, went to ear splitting levels with these IF that"s what you want! As for the Sandisk Clip+, on European setting it"s goodnight - you"ll unquestionably need to put an amplifier with these R70x. Enable "rest of the world" setting, and suddenly you have more than ample volume levels with which to play.
This is easily the most deserving 5/5 I"ve given this year. And so I will be buying a second pair, for backup purposes, if for nothing else, because one pair just isn"t enough. Never have any headphones (and I"ve either tested or owned quite a number in years gone by) inspired me to say, buy these and you truly are buying a one way ticket to "headphone nirvana". Purchase these headphones, and believe me you"ll feel like a child on Xmas morning, waiting to unwrap the best present of his/her life.
