First impressions are good, it feels sturdy and while it's made out of plastic, it is well textured to feel expensive and looks like it could be aluminium from afar.\nI specifically chose this device because it's lightweight (less than 1kg) because i travel a lot and need something that won't be too heavy, This laptop is just right for the job.\nSome of the older chromebooks are limited in how many apps can be installed however some chromebooks (this one included) can also run Linux applications and games. This is currently a beta feature which can be turned on via the settings menu. I turned this on straight away and it allowed me to install some photo editing software and the Open Office suite.\nThe charger for the new version of this Chromebook is a type USB C which is handy.\nThe device has two USB C ports, a USB B port, a Micro SD card slot and finally a 3.5mm headphone jack. That's even better support than a 2018 Macbook Pro. This is really useful because i didn't need a dongle to connect my camera or phone to the device. The Micro SD card slot is also useful for adding extra storage or connecting your phone's memory card.\nThe screen is good for an entry level chromebook. I have no problems viewing text from a distance however the side viewing angles let it down a little bit. But lets be honest, who views the screen from the side very often.\nI really like the keypad. It doesn't feel cheap and the key travel distance is good. The top buttons for sound and brightness are just in the right place. Similarly the  touchpad works well.\nThe sound is quiet but it doesn't sound tinny which is nice. However the sound is very clear with earphones in. You can install Spotify and Google play music.\nYoutube videos play well. I found that some of the older chromebooks struggled with 1080p video streaming but this seems to handle it fine, even with lots of other tabs open. I assume this is because of the 4gb of memory.\nOverall i give this a solid 9/10."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Bought for my 18year old daughter as she needed something lightweight to do her college work on, shes really happy with it! Her sister had one with 2gb ram and it was super slow, this one has 4 and it should be the standard for this type of thing, as in no less than 4gb. Shes an apple fan, so this is her first time having google etc and the playstore, shes already been watching netflix and youtube without any issues, downloading office was straightforward (its free on her college account) and shes can do all of her essays and pick up on another device at college or at home. Shes really happy with it, and im really happy with the price for £159.99 it was really reasonable."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Lack of instuctions has dropped one star, so far all is going well, the built in instructions have allowed me to transfer my email account [ntlworld]  to the chromebook gmail, easily paired it to my epson xp 205 3 in 1 printer , transferred my favourites from chrome on windows to the chromebook, have yet to tackle moving my files but it looks fairly straightforward by sending them to my new gmail account where the chromebook can accept them, we shall see.\nImpressed by the lightness and the speed of opening the screen, looking forward to the built in security living up to its intentions with regular auto updates, got absolutely cheesed off with Windows 10, always seemed to have issues and incompatible programs, updates never cured its faults"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Battery life is fantastic. Charged to 100%, and it lasted 2 and a half days.\nYou get what you pay for. It's a little slow with processing documents through Google Docs, but it's fine.\nAlso runs Android apps, which is a big plus."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Very disappointed! Plugged in...it produced setup...did...no problem as we are IT folk with years of experience..it immediately forced us into updates even though did not give us time to set timeout period. Switched off itself three times then dead...would not boot up.\nWe have bought Asus device before..few years back..same problem. Our WiFi is A1...we have not time to sort out new items that are faulty. Disappointed!"},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Bought this as a Christmas present for the wife. When we booted it up the Chromebook instantly came up with an error with OS. Called tech support straight away...very helpful but sadly I was the 10% where a USB rescovery didn’t work. Very disappointed and will certainly not purchase a chromebook again from first impressions. Have since returned for full refund as out of stock. I have since purchased another laptop for the same value with Windows 10 and is excellent."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"I've been playing with this chromebook for over an hour before my eyes could not handle it. This device is unusable in bright environments or without the night mode and high contrast on. The display on a regular monitor would be bad but on a chromebook that is meant for use outside and in varying conditions, as well as on a go, it's horrendous.\nFirst of all, viewing angles are maybe 10 degrees left and right and maybe 5 degrees up and down. After an hour I started feeling dizzy because my left and right eye saw different things on the monitor from half a meter away when I wasn't perfectly centered on it. What's worse, the distortion is extreme, not only making things harder to read or slightly off-color, but completely invisible under the layer of deep blue or green, dark hues.\nFurthermore, the screen is extremely bright with almost no contrast. It's basically a glorified flashlight that can also display some images. Reading is a chore and frankly impossible for me due to slight issues with sight.\nLastly, I'd like to point out that this is not an anti-glare screen. I honestly feel subjected to false advertising, as this chromebook is basically a mirror. I had to turn off the lights in my room to do anything with it, otherwise I would just mostly see myself. Don't dream of using it outside, even with maximum brightness. I don't think I've ever seen such a bad display in my life.\nOn the upside, it seemed to run pretty well. The keyboard is very nice, although it does have an odd layout. The trackpad is bad but perfectly usable. The device looks and feels good as long as you don't turn it on.\nPlease don't buy this Chromebook if you have an imperfect vision or want an okish display. You're much better off getting a Bluetooth keyboard for a phone."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Very happy with product, exactly as described. Quick delivery.  Only problem is I should have bought larger screen item, purely because my eyesight is not as good as it used to be. Perfect for younger person."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Initially the screen kept freezing with just 3 windows open, but now it is restarting every few minutes .

Viewing angles and screen are bad but good for the price.

Thank you"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is my first chromebook - and I am very pleased with it. The Chrome system works very well. Potential buyers should be sure they know what a chromebook is and how it differs from a windows computer. With the newer chromebooks, such as this one, you have access to the Chrome webstore - and so there are in fact many apps you can install - including microsoft office. You can also access the google playstore - but be aware that the apps there are designed primarily for android phones/tablets. For example, I use the Zoom meetings platform a lot - and initially downloaded the app from the playstore and was puzzled why it was a cut down version of zoom - eventually realising I needed the zoom web application from the Chrome webstore instead - it then worked perfectly. Chromebooks are not designed to have large offline storage space, but are intended mainly for cloud storage - you get a large amount free. This machine has 32 GB storage, which is reasonable for a chromebook - and in addition you can install a memory card. So far I have made two skype calls on this chromebook, both of which worked well and were of much better quality than on my windows desktop computer. The sound is extremely clear. Like all chromebooks, it starts very quickly. All in all, it is a lovely chromebook - extremely light, good looking, and works well. The screen is adequate, and the brightness can be adjusted. There is a standard looking USB slot, a memory card slot, and two of the newer smaller USB 3.1 ports, one of which is also used as the power socket, and I believe these can be used via an adaptor to connect an HDMI lead, and also a headphones socket."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Daughters first
