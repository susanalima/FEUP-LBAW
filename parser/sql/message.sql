I am an office worker so have been using this keyboard for almost a month (alongside a vertical mouse) 9-5, 5 days a week. It improved my wrist pain within days!
It is a regular QWERTY keyboard and has a few additional functions which are proving really useful, there are Undo and Redo buttons on the F keys (that can be easily changed using the F Lock button).
The keyboard is really comfortable, it rises to the middle and back, though it does take a little while to get used to. After a couple of weeks I was back to typing without looking at the keyboard, though I have found out I don’t type in the standard way, my right hand would go to the left side and visa-versa but this is mostly rectified now.
Another hidden benefit is that no one wants to use my desk in work anymore! I have received a lot of compliments of the “cool” looking keyboard and no one wants to go near it so I have my only mini-sanctum at work with no one leaving their dirty cups whilst I am out of the office.
Reasonably priced and I have recommended it to everyone who has asked about it, I also get people to sit at my desk and try it out.
I am really happy with this purchase and so is my physiotherapist, as with this and other adjustments I am on the road to recovery.', '2018-09-04T19:32:54+01:00', '2', 'false', '1010', '11') ;
INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('513', 'Firstly, this is a big keyboard, it has a wow factor right out of the box.
It is going to take up a fair bit of your desk, so it is not something you want to have if you are short on desk space, so do consider the space elements of your workspace before buying, and remember, add in the extra space needed to fly your mouse about your desktop too, if you use one, of course. I generally use a trackball so not such a big issue for me.
The positives, I like the look of it, it looks really smart and well presented and it makes my workstation look like someone serious works there, I mean who would have such a keyboard if they did not mean business.
The keys, for the most part, feel good to touch and the fingertips do not drag like on some keyboards, and your fingertips fit quite well on most of the keys, which of course is a good thing.
I really quite like the curve and contour of the keyboard, it is not too outrageous, and it feels quite comfortable in general, with or without the front riser, though both of these features will take some getting used if you are coming from a regular style keyboard that is flat/straight.
The palm rest padding is rather nice and feels quite good under the palm/heel of the hand, and it really does help keep your hands in a nice place and a comfortable position along with the contour of the keyboard. It means you do not need one of those horrible wrist support things, again this works quite well with or without the front riser, depending upon your height at the desk and how you prefer your hands to hang over the keys.
I like the programmable keys, and if you grab the Microsoft Keyboard and Mouse Center then you can get some more control and customisation going and change a few things to suit your style and workflow. You can see from my pics that there is plenty you can do, even setting some application-specific actions.
It has function lock keys too, which means, each of the function keys can have an alternate use, which can be quite useful in some places, such as emailing, writing documents and similar work, though to be honest your mileage may vary.
The layout, in general, is not bad, but there are a couple of odd design choices here, like the large N key and the narrowed Enter key, amongst them, but nothing that one cannot get used to with a bit of practice and persistence and it does appear help alleviate some of the strain on your hands and wrist, and when used properly you can absolutely benefit from the curvature and angle, in short, your hands, wrist and fingers will get less tired and suffer less strain and will benefit.
There are also a few other little buttons, that could be useful, for example, there are forward and back buttons, which can be used in various applications, media buttons and of course the keyboard has a full-size numeric pad, which is pretty useful if you do lots of number work.
There are a few negatives too. The keys, in general, are fairly soft, though not the softest and not the stiffest, also, travel on the keys is just too much for a keyboard of this nature, it slows you down when you are typing at speed.
The keys, are also fairly quiet when compared to some keyboards, though they are not the quietest by any stretch, this is in part due to the travel but also the resistance of the keys, and the keyboard can sound a bit "creeky" if you move fast across the keys, which kind of annoys me as it makes it sound hollow and cheap.
With front riser on, if you are not above the keyboard then you lose the benefit of the palm rest when you start using the lower rows of the keyboard, which of course becomes uncomfortable. I do not tend to sit too high at the desk, so this setup does not work for me and I removed the front riser as I suspect will most folks, it just feels too severe to me.
The space bar, is simply too stiff either that or it simply does not fit well. If you hit it at the edges, which most folks would tend to do, with a gentle press, then half the time it fails to engage and you can in fact press it right at the edge, and the bar will not even press down on some occasions.
If you hit it a bit harder then the space bar is a bit too loud and clunky, and it is almost like it does not want to press down sometimes, and after a while, it actually starts to make your hand ache.
I have no doubt that in time it is something you could likely get used to, but I have to tell you that it is quite frustrating, flying along and having to stop because you missed the space again or your digit struggles to press the thing down, which it sometimes does.
I have discovered that the only real way to overcome this is to hit the space bar more in the centre, which also slows you down as it is not generally a natural place to strike it on this type of keyboard, though some folks will work around this and may just be ok with it.
The worst part is that it feels so different in comparison to the other keys, it is so much stiffer or even ill-fitting, that it makes the experience almost unpleasant at times and quite frustrating, and makes the whole thing feel like it lacks consistency.
I simply cannot type at my usual speed on this keyboard almost entirely because of the space bar issue and the fact I strike the bar closer to the edges than the centre.
Overall, this is actually a pretty good keyboard, for the most part, the curves are quite nice, it looks very professional, there is a ton of customisation available and it will suit folks looking for a good all-round keyboard to add to their working environment, plus, it offers a couple of ergonomic goodies, such as the built-in palm rest and wrist support, which I actually really like, and the design and build, in general, is quite good.
It does, however, feel and sound quite cheap in places, despite its looks, and for me, it is a touch too noisy and a bit too clunky and creeky, though I suppose it may well quieten down after regular use and once the keys soften, but this may just be wishful thinking and is not something I really believe will happen and for those of you who spend a lot of time at a keyboard, actually typing, as I do, this is going to be a problem.
I also have doubts about getting used to it for some folks, I feel the shallow angle and depth of the keyboard parts will not work for some, and the space bar is definitely an issue for speedy types who will get frustrated with repeated missed engagements of the space bar.
Price wise, it is a fairly competitive, and is definitely worth considering, if you are looking for a decent all-round keyboard with a touch of ergo and style.', '2018-06-21T19:32:54+01:00', '0', 'false', '1010', '4') ;

I can rest my hands comfortably and use the split keyboard with ease and free from pain. Absolutely brilliant.
Then came the crunch, whilst on the box there is a blue sticker with a tick next to Windows 10, none of the hotkeys worked and neither did the zoom function.  I looked at the reviews - 2006!  It is now 2016!  I tried updated the 2006 driver but it was grayed out so that was useless. I spent two hours on the Net looking for instructions to no avail. I asked a question in the Amazon community and had no responses so I decided it had to be returned but as it was so comfortable I would be keeping it until my order of another ergonomic keyboard  arrived. (Also purchased from Amazon.)
Yes, the alternative keyboard arrived, perfectly compatible with Windows 10, but not at all comfortable to use. It said it assisted with the RSI problem but the pain in my arm returned. Long story but guess which one went back on the next day. It was better to have one that prevented pain but did not fully function. However, that is not the end of the story.

Friends of mine, who don"t touch type, call me horrible names for buying such equipment - to which I tell them:
-> please don"t call me names. ;-)
-> learn to touch type :-|
-> go and use your own computer instead...
Anwyay, what I"m trying to say is, if you don"t touch type, this keyboard will likely hinder than help. However, if you DO, I expect - like me - you"ll be enormously grateful for it.
The keys have a lovely feel to them. Clicky enough yet soft. Not fatiguing.
Stuff like Home, End, Delete haven"t been "cooled up" (moved), but are in their default places. Whilst, most "mistakes" can be corrected with Ctrl+Z, not all can! So I"m glad these keys are in their default places - and I can feel (not look) where to press.
This Microsoft 4000 is wired, whereas my last keyboard (Microsoft 8000) was wireless. Pros and cons to both. This 4000 has an excellent wire/cable length which alleviates most of the downsides. Whilst I can"t sit a few metres back and type things anymore, I do ALWAYS have a working keyboard; which doesn"t:
-> need new batteries every other day,
-> need to be re-synched or powered off/on; and
-> drop out when you"re trying to close ONE Firefox Tab and thus close the whole blinking lot!
I use the 4000 in conjunction with a Logitech USB Marble "Mouse" TrackBall, which is equally superb. BUT: The combo omits a scroll wheel. I"ve tried setting up buttons on the 4000, using Microsoft"s customisation program, but haven"t succeeded. What"s SO annoying is that there"s a zoom feature on the keyboard - between where the left and right hands rest, but no scroll! Grrr... If the zoom could be switched, even, I wouldn"t mind. For now, though, Microsoft haven"t (tmk) fixed it.
The 1 to 5 keys (up top) are extemely useful. If you hold them in, they simulate right clicking program 1, program 2, etc (or Win+Alt+1, etc), in your task bar. Nice.
I like the calculator shortcut. It can be reassigned iyl.
Play/pause doesn"t work in VLC unless it"s the active (front most) window. Does in Windows Media Player though. Bit of nepotism, methinks.
No back/forward media shortcuts by default. Easy enough to reassign something else, IF you have the MicroSoft drivers/software installed. (I switch comptuers a lot, and don"t always bother.)
Conclusion:
If you"re not desperate for wireless, and CAN touch type, this is about as good as it gets (except for no scroll).
Hope this helps.

1. Apparently the markings are wearing off - If you rely on markings, you are probably "hunt and peek" typist. Ergonomic keyboards are for touch typists, who don"t need markings at all. Unless you are willing to learn touch typing, this keyboard is not for you. Also trim your nails short, it really helps with typing.
2. Stiff space bar - mine is working perfectly. Some units must be faulty, or Microsoft has made a better revision since then. If you experience problems, do not attempt DIY fixes. Get a replacement.
3. Linux compatibility. Newest kernels have drivers for this baby. Mine worked straight away, including media buttons.
Bottom line - It is a marvelous peace of equipment. Hand rest is great, no more hovering. No more awkward wrist twisting. You will need some time to get used to it, but its worth it.

After less than a year of use the left mouse button stopped working properly. It "clicks" but the click doesn"t always register and I often have to try several times to get it to work. This issue renders this mouse useless. On top of that the "Windows" button on the mouse stopped giving any "click" feedback, although it still works if I press it strong enough. I"ve used my previous Logitech keyboard/mouse combo for more than 4 years. This one is falling apart in less than a year.
--------------------------------------------
I have mixed feelings about this keyboard/mouse combo. I give the mouse 2.5 stars and the keyboard 3.5 stars (so 3 stars average).
I had the original MS Natural Elite and then I moved to the Logitech split keyboard (Cordless Desktop Comfort Laser). Unfortunately Logitech stopped making split keyboards some years ago, so I changed to their "Wave" keyboard, which never felt as comfortable. I bought the Sculpt a bit more than a month ago and now I am getting used again to split keyboards - I hope that it will feel as natural as the previous split keyboards I had (so far I don"t feel as comfortable with it. I hope it is just a matter of time)
*Mouse* 2.5 Stars
There is nothing special about the mouse. It is just an average mouse, not a particularly good one. I didn"t find it any more "ergonomic" or comfortable than my previous mouse (a Logitech M705) and I am bit less accurate with this mouse. The 2 side buttons are pretty bad: They are less customizable than those on Logitech mice, and you have to press them in a particular way otherwise the click doesn"t register! Also, if I am selecting a large paragraph of text it will sometimes lose the selection and I will have to start from the beginning.
*Keyboard* 3.5 Stars
Pros:
+ It looks good
+ The keys feel nice, like nice laptop keys.
+ The separate number pad is something positive for me, since I rarely use it.
+ I like the split layout (the main reason I bought it).
+ it is wireless. I hate wires and this is the only widely available wireless split keyboard.
Cons:
- No dedicated media buttons (I solved this problem, see bellow)
- The layout is cramped on the right side. They tried to make it as compact as possible, but this comes at the cost of usability. I often press the wrong key if I try to press e.g. one of the arrow keys without looking.
- The soft arm rest feels nice but it seems to be somewhat absorbent (like a cloth) and it gets dirty easily (and you can"t just wipe it clean)
- The Ctrl key gets "virtually" stack every now and then. I have to press it again to make the keyboard work properly. This is VERY annoying.
- The software offers very limited customization of the keys.
- The function keys are actually buttons and they don"t feel as nice. Not a huge problem for me.
This keyboard wins points for being the only widely available wireless split keyboard. If you want a wireless ergonomic keyboard then this keyboard has very little competition and you should try it. But if you are not looking specifically for an ergonomic keyboard then I will suggest to stay away because this keyboard has several issues.
Avoid the mouse unless the keyboard/mouse combo is less than £15 more expensive than the keyboard only option. The mouse in my opinion doesn"t worth more than £15. (only problem is that then you will need to use 2 different USB receivers)
Personally I would have returned this product (especially after the Ctrl key started getting stack) but I stayed with it because of the lack of alternatives for this sort of keyboards.
Regarding the media buttons I use the free program AutoHotkey (and AudioSwitch for the audio, but everything can be done with just AutoHotkey) to remap certain keys. So now the "Pause" button acts as a "play/pause" toggle, the "ScrLk" button acts as a "next track", "PgUp / PgDn" are "Volume UP / Down" and "Insert" is a "Mute" toggle. This way I never need to use the function keys switch. I used AudioSwitch to remap the sound related functions (volume up / down / mute) because I already had that program and it gives you an indication on the screen when you are increasing/ decreasing the volume or muting, which I believe AutoHotkey doesn"t.', '2018-10-27T19:32:54+01:00', '0', 'false', '1587', '42') ;

NOPE - not when microsoft - they dont sell replacemennts and after talking to their "customer care dept - I think this is a joke as they didnt really care" - they informed me this is very common fault and the dongles are paid with the mouse / keyoard / number pad so cant be replaced.

read the messages boards online and you will see there is no fix for this and spares cant be purchased for any part should it die.

The separate numpad is a nice plus since it allows you to put it wherever is comfortable, and it all (including the mouse) goes through the same receiver, so only uses 1 USB port.
On the downside, it"s wireless USB with no wired option so there"s the potential security issue if MS didn"t use decent encryption (we"ll never know, I guess), there"s no indicator lights on the keyboard or numpad to show whether caps or num lock are on, and the mouse is quite uncomfortable to use because the edge between where your thumb goes and where your palm goes is quite sharp (though maybe I"m just used to my Anker vertical mouse).
Interesting points:
* There"s F-keys with alternate functions, and which one you use depends on the position of the little switch on the top right of the keyboard. Personally, I"d prefer an Fn key which you can hold down to activate the alternate functions but the switch works ok. It"s interesting because it"s the first time I"ve seen a switch for something like this, and we don"t see too many actual switches these days. It"s almost retro.
* There"s a pair of thumb buttons on the left side of the mouse. The blue one is a Windows button, because that"s where I always keep my Windows buttons? There"s one on the keyboard, and we"ve survived this long without one on the mouse so I"m not sure why it seemed like a good idea to put one there. The other button is a black recessed button and almost invisible, and seems to do a random function each time you click it. I suspect that if I click it enough times, it will open the door to Narnia.

This set works off of just one USB dongle for both items, which are paired to this one USB dongle (found in the base of the mouse) at the factory. If you purchase a separate mouse, or the keyboard, *alone*; they"ll need a separate dongle (and free USB port) for each. This set only requires one USB port for *both* the mouse & keyboard together.
MOUSE: This right-handed mouse was purchased as an upgrade from my previous wired Microsoft Comfort mouse which had buttons that were starting to fail. I"ve never used an "ergonomic" type mouse before and was somewhat concerned that I might have to re-adjust my hand movement to use such a design.
This is not a problem at all! It fits the hand so well that within seconds of use I was upset I hadn"t always had such a mouse! This is SUCH a good mouse.
The "BlueTrack" technology tracks brilliantly on any surface (except for mirror finished glass & metal). It"s reported to track more surfaces than a high-end laser mouse.
I really like the size and weight. I don"t like "mobile" sized mice for daily work. So this is a pleasure to use. It has a great weight to it, probably due to the two AA batteries that it runs off. It weighs in at around 5.47 oz (155 g). Regarding battery life; remember to turn off the mouse at the end of use to preserve battery life. If you do that, Microsoft estimate many months of use per set of batteries.
Holding this mouse keeps your hand tilted to the right, in a comfortable position. It feels much better to use than a regular mouse, where your hand lies flat over the top of the unit. With this mouse, your right hand rests naturally on it"s right side, as you would if you put your hand on a desk in a relaxed way.
It"s got 5 buttons (7 if you count all the wheel"s movements) that are all mappable to whatever you want them to do using the Microsoft Mouse & Keyboard Centre v2.8 software. I"ve made the inside thumb button a "Double Click" and it"s great. You can change the blue Windows logo button to whatever you want, but by default it"s set to open the Start Menu and I"ve found it really useful. The scroll wheel has 4-way scrolling that enables up, down, left, and right navigation and presses in as well. All these movements are mappable to whatever you want in the software.
Connectivity is a breeze. Just plug the little 2.4 GHz dongle into a USB 2 port and it"s instantly recognised in Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, Windows 10 Phone, Macintosh Mac OS X v10.7-10 and Android 3.2-5.0. I was surprised as to how easy it all was. The range for the transceiver is around 10" (3 meters) so that"s plenty.
It glides around on it"s clever magnetically held base brilliantly, and is an instant hit with everyone that sees it. They all want one in the office!
KEYBOARD: I waited quite a while to write about this, as it took time to get used to this keyboard, as I"ve never used a split keyboard before. The very first impression is deeply affected by whether you use the magnetically attached tilt base or not. This option is more ergonomic, but as a newcomer to split keyboards, who doesn"t touch type, I found it slowed my typing down so much that I couldn"t use it and keep the speed I"m used to. (I type really fast on regular flat, clacky keyboards!) I decided to remove the stand after a three weeks and see how that went. There was an instant improvement in typing speed and spelling/input accuracy. However, I"m still slower on a split keyboard than a regular keyboard.
In use the keyboard is perfectly functional. I"ve not noticed any "mistakes" in wireless transmission as reported by some reviewers. I do notice that I often "miss" the split space-bar and hit the huge "Alt" button instead. It"s also taking me quite some time to get used to the position of the Delete button, where I hit the Return or Insert buttons instead.
Something to get used to is that the Function "F-buttons" are shared with the media buttons via a switch. Shift the switch right and all the F-buttons are normal. Shift the switch left, and they all function as mappable media keys, not all of which work on Windows 10 through the Microsoft Mouse & Keyboard Centre v2.8 software. I found the "Snap windows right and left" buttons didn"t work for me. Because of this, I leave the switch in the regular F-button mode and don"t use the media keys much.
I"m puzzled over the decision to separate the numeric number pad. I think it would have been better to incorporate it into the keyboard, as I stow it away on my desk to save space I end up using it less because of it. This separate pad runs off a large CR2430 Lithium button cell, while the keyboard runs off of a pair of AAA batteries, that - unlike the mouse - can"t be turned off. However, comments & reviews say they last a long time.
This set comes with a limited 3 year warranty for peace of mind. I really can"t recommend this mouse highly enough for right-handed desktop or laptop use. Regarding the keyboard: It"s a great unit, both high quality and responsive. But, there"s a learning curve if you"ve never used an ergonomic or split keyboard previously. Thankfully, the tilt-stand is removable so you can ease your way into the whole ergonomic thing! This is a really good set, opens up a USB port if you"re using two wired, or two separate wireless, units and frees the desk of wires. I would recommend this set for any right-handed Windows desktop PC user.', '2018-12-02T19:32:54+00:00', '0', 'false', '1587', '46') ;

I thought the product looked cool and liked the idea of being more ergonomic since I have a touch of RSI.
The product does look cool but apart from that I"m a bit disappointed.  It is a bit wider than the old Mobile 6000 which means the mouse is a bit further right.  Also, I find the hole in the middle of the keyboard a nuisance. I type fast but I don"t touch type.  Most of the time I am coding which means I"m typing punctuation marks which need the shift key a lot more often than in normal English and also using the mouse to select and cut/paste a lot.  My fingers want to cross over the gap in the middle of the keyboard and that just doesn"t work that well.  If you touch type and rest your fingers on the home keys and never cross into the other hands "territory" the keyboard would probably work fine.  But I"d still prefer something smaller.  Compared to a small USB connected mechanical keyboard like the Noppoo Choc Box 84 this is much quieter, a bit larger, doesn"t feel as nice and is occasionally noticeably laggy.
Also the mouse is a "half way house" between a normal mouse you hold palm down and one of the expensive ergonomic ones you need to hold with your palm facing the side of the mouse.  It doesn"t work for me: it isn"t tall enough that I want to hold it like a "proper" ergonomic mouse but it is just tall enough that it doesn"t feel totally right when I hold it like a normal mouse.  Your mileage may vary - it probably depends on the size of your hands.
The numeric pad is nice.
So all in all a bit disappointing but not a terrible purchase: it is usable and it does look cool. If you touch type, have small hands and need something quiet it might work for you.', '2018-09-03T19:32:54+01:00', '2', 'false', '1587', '36') ;

In fact, the mouse is the item that I am probably most impressed with in this set.
I"ve only just started using this keyboard and am struggling to get used to it initially. The spacing between the keys feels a little unnatural compared to conventional keyboards. In the past, I owned a Microsoft Wireless Laser Desktop 5000 (not to be confused with the "Comfort" Desktop 5000), and that keyboard was more of a conventional keyboard with a curve. This keyboard definitely feels much more ergonomic. The shape of it is great for the hand placement. It"s the layout of the keys that I can"t quite get used to. I find myself hitting the "#" key, instead of the "Enter" key quite often. You also have to stretch your fingers quite far to reach the number keys. Also, if you are used to hitting the "b" key with your right hand, you will have to re-learn to reach for it with your left hand, which to be honest, doesn"t take too long (but it can be frustrating if you"ve been a touch-typist for some years).
So far, I have not experienced any wireless issues (but there"s still time I guess). All my keystrokes seem to be registered and the mouse is accurate enough for me. I don"t perform CAD work, but sometimes like to create pixel-perfect grabs of areas of the screen and it works well enough for this.

 but still perfectly usable keyboard for work (I code all day and write a lot of documents) and having recently suffered with a flare up of an old shoulder injury I decided to make the switch. So far so good.  Obviously a keyboard and mouse switch is only part of the solution.
The mouse included in this set, while I was sceptical at first, turns out to be really nice to use.  Its not quite a drastic shift to that of the new mouse I use in work (
) but I love the fact that I do notice a difference and it is comfortable to use.  Again, I use the mouse for everyday and then switch to a gaming mouse while gaming (funnily enough) as the speed and accuracy of the Sculpt mouse isn"t up to shooter/MMO requirements. General everyday use, fine.  I love the fact that, if I don"t need it, I can put the numpad away, out of sight and then call on it when required. Also, if I wanted, I could put this in a backpack and take this with me on travels as the Bluetooth dongle is stowed in the Sculpt mouse.  The only drawbacks for me, personally, is the shiny piano black plastic aka fingerprint magnet, but, as is with most modern devices, this is accepted that it will require polishing every now and then when it begins to look a bit grubby. Also, the function keys and their usage is defined by a function key switch, which takes some getting used too (switching a switch to define if the key is a normal F"something" or a shortcut for a function (play/pause). Something that I"m sure I"ll get used too over time. Would I recommend? Yes. Definitely.', '2018-04-30T19:32:54+01:00', '0', 'false', '1587', '14') ;

Had this for 4-5 months and I"m loving it. I chose now to write a review as the batteries in the mouse have only just died, after daily use for both work and my personal PC. The keyboard is still going strong. I"m very impressed with the battery life.
The keyboard is very comfortable and I have noticed a significant reduction in the aches and pains I was starting to develop from excessive computer use. This was my main reason from switching over from my mechanical keyboard. The mouse is also comfortable, keeping your hand at a more natural angle while in use. The mouse is a little heavy, which may be a problem for some but I spend more time on the keyboard. The separate number pad is welcomed as it can be moved freely, or in my case stored away as I do not use it. The chiclet style keys are as good as they can be and also stop any dirt getting down under the keys, making cleaning easier.
I have knocked off one star for the function and media keys. They are actually buttons which is in itself a minor annoyance, and there is no dedicated function key, instead you have to physically switch back and forth (similar to shift vs. caps lock). In addition the software for rebinding the mouse keys was limited unnecessarily, e.g. you could set one button to play/pause music but that option would not be available on another button.

All these adjustments mean typing is a little slower but it"s a much cheaper keyboard than the K800 and still performs well at it"s price point.

Once I had built my PC, I needed the smaller essentials - a mouse and a keyboard. Whilst Amazon was awash with cheap brands all claiming to be "hardcore gamer" gear - something despite being a gamer, I find grotesquely childish. All I needed was for a keyboard to be black (dark), cheap, QUERTY and wireless. So it was at the massive online seller that I found this - from Logitech - a commonly known brand amongst technology buffs and your average office drone. When I got this it was clear that it is meant for comfort rather than durability because it is very light and the marks on the keys look like cheap stickers. Plus 2 of the rubber grips that keep the board in place had come loose - 2 downsides right away. Time however would prove to be a great ally as everything else I have to say is either a positive or information based. Responsiveness is surprisingly swift considering it is wireless. In other words, it"s a lot tougher than it looks.
Design & Features
Because it"s quite dark, you don"t hugely notice the ugly, loopy pattern (looks like scribbles) that adorns the plastic - but it does help you distinguish the keys a little better as opposed to viewing black on black with only a white letter/number/symbol etc being an indicator. It has a goldish yellow colour for the multi-keys - hit "FN" and you can make use of 16 additional buttons that include shortcuts to home, email, music, windows,"My Computer", calculator, lock computer, power-off, print screen etc. There is a handy on/off switch at the top right which means you can preserve battery life - although the board does "sleep" when there is no signal from the USB wireless adaptor - again, handy. Speaking of the wireless capabilities, the usb plug in is simple, small and can be stored inside the battery compartment when not in use. It even comes with 2x AA batteries which is nice. Battery life is very very long which is a major plus - its almost akin to that of a watch"s life. 6 additional oval buttons are a fairly nice feature that control both volume and media/song control - not essential but certainly a shortcut. By the way, it is just over 15cm tall and about 36cm wide and it"s really thin. Not Mac Keyboard thin but varying from 1 to 1.5cm thick.

Price & Availability
DO NOT search for this exact model though! Because you will only find it for prices upwards of £60! Instead, merely search "Logitech keyboard K360" - in fact the website shouted this at me - "You purchased this item on 7 Aug 2013." It"s currently available for £24.99 but if you want to sacrifice style and a bit of dignity, you can always get the cheaper Victorian Wallpaper variant which is just £18.99 - fair warning, it"s hideous. eBay will display some equally disgusting looking models for even cheaper - one was only £9.99 (plus P&P) but had an extremely feminine oriental pattern on it, others were indigo and some just had terribly dire Photoshop brushes on them. I wouldn"t want to have to stare at a distracting bit of clumsy design when trying to focus on typing. Choose wisely.', '2018-08-25T19:32:54+01:00', '2', 'false', '1822', '29') ;
INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('545', 'I have been using an MK710 keyboard with my desktop for some years. It has plenty of bells and whistles but, as I am not a gamer, many of the functions were never used. For some time I have found the keys too soft, too close together and too high profile. It was common to accidentally press two keys by glancing off one to the adjacent key.  I was looking for a new keyboard with well spaced keys, low profile and a firm touch giving a definite feeling of resistance against a moderate force and finally, one that would also take up less desk space.
I first bought a keyboard direct from China at £10. It was fairly near to what I had in mind but was erratic in performance and turned out to be too small for comfortable, regular use. Perhaps not surprising at such a low cost.
I had visited the Logitech website several times, looking for something suitable but seemed to end up browsing the MK and G series keyboards only. It was while looking up the LifeHacker.com website that I came across the K series. Seemed to be just what I wanted. I ordered it for delivery to France and received it two days later ! It has turned out to fulfill virtually 100% of my notional spec. It"s a decent size, has clear, well marked keys, good spacing between adjacent keys with nice, low profiles. Setting up took about two or three minutes out of the box. I had other equipment connected to a Unifying USB Receiver. This didn"t recognise the keyboard at  first, so I plugged the Receiver that came with the keyboard into a second USB port.
Logitech software immediately recognised that I was using two receivers and gave me the opportunity to remove the new one, which I did and, after following the simple options menu the new keyboard had been added to the original receiver. Ready to use !
It is well designed and laid out for a medium sized keyboard and has plenty of extra functions. Nothing that, as a non-gamer, I miss from my MK710. I chose the black version as I didn"t fancy the Victorian wallpaper version and from previous reviews I am glad I did. I can understand that "professional" typists at speed might not find it comfortable but for me it has been a completely satisfactory buy.

With the Craft at the ridiculous high end price of £179; it was out of the running.  The Surface keyboard has a similar price to the K800, but with no backlit or other features I thought I would just be paying for the aesthetics. So I decided to safe some cash and opted for the K360.
Once it arrived I paired it up with my already existing Unifying dongle; another reason for the purchase.  And then got to typing.  This is where everything fell short.  The feel of the keys were a bit hash to press and if you are someone like me who spends most of their hours bashing on a keyboard then you will know how cruel to your fingers some keyboards can be.  The other thing that put me off was the fact that the cursor keys are smaller and slightly out of alignment to the bottom row.  This is something I did not notice in the photos, but was vastly apparent when it came to using them.
My verdict is that this is not a bad keyboard for the price and has proved to me that you sometimes pay for what you get.  In the end I shipped the keyboard back and opted for the Surface Keyboard.

Downsides...? None in this application... other than unfortunately, it"s finished in a "polished black" so while it may look really nice, it properly attracts dust and filthy finger marks. More so if the regular end user is six.

I will say that as a moderate touch typist (around 60 wpm), this keyboard works well, as it allows for travel and the fact that I can type without hitting the wrong keys (unless the wrong keys happen to be user error, or bad spelling (again user error)), owing to the fact that there is enough space between each of the keys for my fat fingers to get "tangled up".
The battery life is as good as listed and there is even an "on/off" button should you want to preserve battery life even longer.
The only thing I will say and I don"t know whether this is really a critiscisam or not, is that the "s" key has faded away, now as I say being a touch typist I do not really need to know where the letters are as I type by "touch" (providing I have the layout set to the correct language), I have not really used this key any more than any others (well apart from maybe the "z", "x"), so I am not really sure why this key should be fading. If you are a "hen and peck" typist, or a one/two finger typist then this may cause a problem, but as I say apart from this minor consideration, I have nothing but praise for this keyboard.

When I saw this advertised I honestly thought, nope, it will be a good effort but not really worthwhile.  How wrong was I...
Honestly, this just makes me happy typing again and I type a lot.
It"s the same size as the magic keyboard (with number pad) and works just as well.
The aluminium top gives it that quality feel, they keys themselves when pressed feel almost rubbery but they are not. They have a bit more travel than the Apple version but still, give that satisfying dull thud but not a click or clunk.  You hear the keys being pressed but not annoyingly so as I find with mechanical keyboards.
Another benefit it has over the magic keyboard is that it is slightly more elevated for a more comfortable typing position.
The colour is very nice, not in your face bright however not so dark you get lost finding keys.  Even in dim light, it is still quite visible.  Sure, if there was a backlight it would take it above great however, I understand that would likely drain the battery at a rate we would all be unhappy with.  If Microsoft did (and should) produce a wired version with a backlight I would likely buy it as well.
There are several useful keys for Windows related shortcuts.  Cortana, Task Windows, Control Panel, Calculator, lock PC,  and it has all the usual media buttons.
It hibernates itself, no need to switch it on and off.
I am using this with a self-built PC that has no Bluetooth so had to buy a USB Bluetooth dongle.  Having read reviews that suggest it drops connection I made the assumption that this could be due to using cheaper sub £5 dongles that are often flaky, so I went for something with good reviews at a higher price.  To be honest, if you are going to spend this much on a keyboard make sure you get a quality Bluetooth dongle to support it, not a £2 one that will likely give you issues.
I went with this one:
Using Windows 10, plugged it in and immediately spotted the keyboard, paired and done.  No lag experienced, not dropped once (that I have noticed) and both work perfectly together.
The exact steps were:
1.  Plug in Bluetooth USB
2.  Press and hold button under keyboard until it enters pairing mode (flashing light above the up arrow, not visible until it flashes).
3.  Go to the Bluetooth menu and search for new devices then select "Surface Keyboard"
4.  Type in the 5 digit number and press enter.
5.  Done.
Whilst I am aiming a lot of this review at the converting Mac user that in no way suggest it is not suitable for everyone else.  I highly recommend this keyboard if it is in the style you like I really can"t see anyone being disappointed with this.
Will update again time, however, for now, loving it :)
Update:
It is now the Middle of July 2018.  Really just wanted to echo what I said above, the keyboard is still working away great and it really is my best keyboard yet.  Still the same set of batteries running it after a year.
On occasion when you leave it for a while it takes a few seconds to wake itself up.  Sometimes I have started typing something to find it"s not caught up.  Minor point and the only niggle I have with it.

The Microsoft Surface Bluetooth Keyboard has perfect key-travel, feels great to type on, doesn"t miss a key-stroke, and works great with Linux (I don"t use Microsoft Windows at all, period). On Linux, things like the volume control and brightness controls work, as does the "lock" key (which I find very handy). Something I really like is the perfect UK key layout - all the keys are in the "right" place (something that isn"t always the case with cheap keyboards).
It would have been nice if this keyboard included backlighting, but that"s not a big issue for me. I also thought the name of this keyboard was rather confusing. Not sure why Microsoft threw "Surface" in to the model name. It made it more difficult for me to find online.
I don"t like Microsoft as a company, but this keyboard is awesome (and works with Linux!). I am keenly waiting for the Microsoft Modern keyboard to go on sale in the UK, and will probably buy a couple of those too (for my desktop computers). I like the way the new Microsoft Modern keyboard gives you the option to connect via Bluetooth or cable!

I used it with Windows 10 and, as one would expect with a Microsoft product, it paired and worked flawlessly. (Although it still wanted a reboot. Are we not over this yet, Microsoft?)
The keys are good; I can touch type without any problems. Perhaps not the quietest, or the most tactile, of keyboards, but perfectly functional.
The trackpad isn"t as sensitive as I would like. Small movements don"t register, and it has a slightly herky-jerky feel to it.  Nonetheless, it"s perfectly adequate for clicking buttons and highlighting text.
If you read the quickstart guide carefully, there is an app to configure the trackpad behaviour and a few of the hotkeys. I like that you can configure app specific behaviour, but I wish I could configure a bit more. In particular, I would like to configure the top row of keys to function as F-keys (F1, F2 ... F12) rather than multimedia keys by default.

The two finger trail across track pade acts as page drag/ scroll and you still have option of right click left click at the bottom of track pad.
Downfall - if one is not fluent with the keyboard then there will be slight issues using this thing in the dark, the are no led lights not even to indicate Caps. And worst part of all... it holds TWO triple A batteries in its rare. I hate chargers and Worse I hate battery life. complete wireless with no need to recharge or constantly having to walk to the shops for bolks of BATTERIES  would have simply been great. This does not seem to have a rechargeable kit compatibility so I will have to consistently go marching for batteries... awesome Microsoft.
For a little device it sure is not light in weight, in fact it is very very heavy. For some good, but for me I don"t like it. Once it"s placed at a desk it will not budge.
Positives - It is completely windows 8 friendly with no installation disks no nonsense literally you just plug it in like any old keyboard and it is perfect to please your desires around the web or whatever. No calibration needed at all it is seamless.  I"m sure It will be great for Windows ten as will try it soon, I doubt at all I will find any complications.
But as I"m running on batteries I don"t want to rival the keyboard with a long review, As I know batteries can last weeks, month and a year few month in most appliances other than remotes which nowadays stemming back from late nineties even remotes began getting more demanding of energy consumption. I guess this thing has month"s of consistent usage before life span of batteries die out. I just bought it I"m THINKING about battery life... dam I"m back in late 80"s 90"s...

On reading the reviews online the Microsoft All-In-One Media Keyboard seemed to be the one to go for. The included trackpad made perfect sense as did the long battery life.
My only concerns with this keyboard and track pad combination was whether it would work with the Raspberry PI or indeed with my PC.
On receiving the parcel from Amazon I installed the supplied batteries and tried it out on my desktop PC. The included USB dongle is nice and small and has a decent range. I was able to enter the PC BIOS, which i wasn"t sure would work but it did and was able to make some test adjustments and on the dual boot screen was able to select Windows 10. I have a dual boot Hackintosh machine and wanted to see how well it would work in Windows 10 first.
The keyboard was immediately recognized by Windows 10 and all the shortcut keys worked as expected. On trying it in MacOs it worked just as well. Really pleased with it and made having a PC in the front room a very tempting idea, however the Raspberry PI is a lot more discreet and does everything I need, mainly running KODI.
On trying it on the Raspberry PI 2 the small dongle fits perfectly in any of the 4 USB slots without compromising the others, handy as I like to use a WIFI dongle in one and a USB hard drive in the other.
Raspbian recognized the keyboard straight away without need for any drivers and KODI works perfectly.
This keyboard is perfect if you need an all in one setup for the front room or a study, the keys are very responsive and the track pad is nice a precise and makes using either my Hackintosh or Raspberry Pi 2 a pleasure.

This keybord DOES NOT have a Print Screen key, so if that is something that bothers you, don"t buy it. Also, they keys are not customizable so if you use ALT combinations (like ALT+F4 to close the window), be warned that you will need to add also third key to this combination (called Fn) in order to achieve the same result. The F keys at the top work but without the Fn key they are all shortcuts and, in the case of F4, it puts your computer to sleep.
Distance is also a bit of a problem. From 10 feet away it sometimes stutter a little bit. From 15 feet it is unusable.

Keyboard feel much nicer than i would have expected. Keys have a nice feel to them. Good size, on and off switch on top, media keys above the function keys. Great value for how much it costs. Got 77wpm on 10fastfingers which is the same as i get with my K95 with MX browns.
Mouse is decent. Feels a bit on the smaller size which i"m ok with as i have smaller hands, and makes it more compact overall, but people with larger hands might not like it. It"s also rather light, which again could be good or bad. Tracks well.
Both set up very easy. Plugged in the usb dongle and they worked instantly, i thought i"d have to pair them over bluetooth or something.

Despite this being a new model, I assumed it would basically be the same as my previous keyboard and mouse set. It was in the same price bracket. So how much different could it be? I"ve been using logitech keyboards for years now.
But I was wrong. The build quality is terrible on this compared to the one I got 3 or 4 years ago. That felt sturdy and survived many, many bumps, knocks and drops. Everything here feels lightweight.
The finish on the keys makes typing a less than pleasurable experience they also make more sound than on the previous model.
The mouse is smaller and so less easy to use and  the clicks on the buttons are noisy, and the wheel is also noisier than my previous version. The wheel action also feels less smooth. The on/off button under the mouse rattles or knocks quite a lot as the mouse is moved around. There"s a little noise as it rattles around. It will become irritating very soon I expect.
Why they"ve bothered to include an on/off switch on both items is a bit mystifying. Batteries hardly got eaten up by them in the past and I can"t imagine anyone using the switches a lot. Also the switches don"t feel like they"d stand up to much use. They money would have been better off being spent elsewhere.

I have had it for around a month or so and it is fantastic, excellent response times when moving and clicking i have it set to default 800dpi and that is spot on for me when i am playing games like Battlefield 1, CS:GO, Battlegrounds, etc. It has really upped my aiming ability, and i bought this to replace the logitech g303 which had a faulty side mouse button. I dont regret switching from the pixart 3366 sensor, to the one in this mouse which is a new "Mercury" sensor and according to many it performs just as good if not better than the pixart 3366 and i would agree it feels a lot better.
The RGB lighting is a nice touch for this mouse, its very comfortable to use and i have quite large hands and it fits perfectly. I can game for many hours without and aches or pains in my hand using this mouse.
It looks identical to the Logitech G Pro the only difference between the two is this mouse has a different sensor that only goes up to 6000dpi where as the "G Pro" has a sensor capable of 12,000dpi but who uses 12.000dpi for gaming??? Also the cable for this mouse is rubber, the "G Pro" has a braided cable.
The mouse comes well packaged as always with logitech products, there is NO software included with the mouse, so you will have to download that from the logitech website. The software will allow you to set macros, adjust and save (to the mouse"s internal memory) many dpi settings to suit your play style. You can also adjust the lighting options for the mouse with many options to pick from, the software is straght forward and very easy to use.
But all in all value for money this is spot on, it looks identical to its expensive brother the "Logitech G Pro" and performs just as good at a fraction of the price.
I Highly recommend this mouse, I already convinced a friend to buy one and he loves it. I find personally Logitech make the best computer mice on  the market.

The mouse wheel has a nice texture and the notches have positive feedback without being noisy.
6 months later it is still going strong, and a recent firmware update brings the sensor resolution to 8000 DPI. That"s almost over 9000! Maybe next update?

Firstly, I"ll discuss functionality. I play CSGO, and I play at 400dpi with 3.0 sensitivity (arguably the upper limit of having accurate dexterity). I have transitioned to this mouse from using the Final Mouse 2016, and I have noticed a qualitative improvement -- most likely due to better ergonomic design rather than the sensor.
The G403 comes with a 10g weight that can be removed. As I was transitioning from the Final Mouse, an extremely lightweight mouse, I removed the weight. I adapted to the G403 almost instantly. Ergonomic shape is perfect for me, and is an improvement from the Final Mouse.
I have found one functional limitation of the G403, which is the very shallow thumb area. Meaning, that while the mouse has almost perfect functionality in lifts (does not track during mouse lifts), you will find that it tilts clockwise in your hand causing a less controlled landing. However, keep in mind that I am transitioning from the extremely lightweight Final Mouse which has one of the deepest thumb indents.
Additionally, the mouse-wheel is loose and can over-scroll, and the sensitivity button is too sensitive for a button that is rarely going to be pressed. I personally do not find these problematic, but I understand they can be problems for other users -- no mouse is perfect.
As mentioned in the title, the design is a leap in the right direction (back to the G400). Its colour is very deep black and has no plastic reflection; it"s almost invisible upon a black mouse pad if not for the two subtle RGB lights. I give it 4/5 for design and hope they continue to adopt more subtle and elegant design in the future. I personally do not want a mouse that looks like a race car or a spaceship, i.e. G402.
The 403 is well designed, solid in construction, with a resilient braided cable. It also, of course, has full RBG colour spectrum, which I have never used or care about.
What really sets this mouse apart from its competitors, including the rest of the Logitech range, is that it is cheaper. I paid £37.99 for it. To give context, the Final Mouse was designed for Esport in mind and was retailed at £60; the G403 is objectively as good, and in my opinion, the G403 is an upgrade for me.
The G403 is basically a statement by Logitech that they are a brand leader. For around £100 they sell a wireless optical mouse (G900), which is a massive breakthrough in wireless technology -- it has no latency or interference. The G403 is them saying that they can do what their competitors do for around half the price.', '2018-08-08T19:32:54+01:00', '1', 'false', '2311', '57') ;

I do not want to put off any potential buyers looking into buying this keyboard. Logitech rarely goes wrong with their devices and peripherals. However, today is the day I had a faulty purchase. Upon buying the keyboard, there was nothing wrong exterior-wise, just the fact that a single key, and as it turns out to be the most important key for gaming, did not fully function correctly.
The "W" key was faulty in a sense that pushing the button down with small force did not trigger the function of the button. I had to either angle it forwards and push down or push down a bit harder in the centre to trigger it. The problem I have with this is that a so-called "gaming keyboard" SHOULD NOT have any problems with its keys, ESPECIALLY the most important heavily-used keys like "WASD" (hence the 2 stars in the "for gaming" category). In my honest opinion, if the "W" key or any valuable key is faulty, or not functioning at 100% as it should be, it should be returned and reconfigured by the manufacturers. But like the title states, my keyboard turned out to be faulty. I do not speak on behalf of every keyboard sent to each customer.
On a side note, the positives of the keyboard are that, if you choose to buy the keyboard with the palm rest/wrist rest, there is plenty of space without the trouble of getting Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) from long-term gaming hours. It is comfortable and the additional sound/volume audio control located at the top right section of the keyboard is very accessible and has a nice rubber feel to the buttons. I cannot comment on the durability of the keyboard since I had it for roughly 3 hours before packing it all back up in getting ready to send it back. All in all, it is a fairly comfortable keyboard to use, but to ensure what I said is 100% accurate, I will purchase the keyboard (hoping this time it will have no faults) again and see how it goes.
It should be noted as well that you cannot control the backlighting RGB of the keyboard itself, it goes on a rotation of the spectrum of colours (16 million colours or however many it claims to have) and you also cannot control how bright the backlit colour is either. You can only turn it on or off. But it is not highly bright nor is it dim, so in my opinion, it has the right amount of brightness.
I rate it 3 stars in total overall, due to the "W" faulty key, had it been not a problem, it would have been a solid 4 stars for what it has to offer in the extra advanced features.', '2018-06-19T19:32:54+01:00', '0', 'false', '2311', '11') ;

I was looking for a replacement for my old, trusty G5 (RIP) and so my quest begun. Like a nugget, I spent some time (probably too much) looking around and comparing these bad boys and eventually managed to test how it fits in my hand in one of the local retailers. It was just right and felt familiar! It isn"t exactly the way G5 was (in a good way) but it"s very close and, I can carry on saving the world (or not, whatever). Cable isn"t too long or too short, it fits fine in my hand (small/medium hand, fingertip grip). I snatched this one on sale for £25 and it was definitely worth it!
A year (and a bit) later and I still love it - it"s my main hunter. The only annoyance is the bloomin" middle click - it isn"t what it used to be... Apparently it"s a common thing but what can we do, aye? Saying this, the past couple of months it"s been fine - maybe showing it some love helps.
***Check out attached pictures!***
The Good:
#great for all grips
#reminds me of G5 (yay!)
#good ergonomics
#smooth operator
#good lighting
#programmable buttons(comes in handy!)
#cable quality
The Bad:
#mouse wheel click not as responsive as when I first got the mouse
Verdict:
In love. Would buy again.', '2019-02-20T19:32:54+00:00', '0', 'false', '2311', '4') ;

The mouse works perfectly fine for the average user browsing the web. No real complaints at all. For the price you really can"t expect much, but it"s surprisingly ergonomic (Although this obviously varies per person), surprisingly well made and it also works straight away on both windows 7 + 10.
If you"re the sort of person who "sometimes" uses photoshop, does a little word processing or web design etc then it may not be "just" as good a buy.

Undocumented are the Q,W,E keys which are also marked Android,Win,iOS. These do not switch the keyboard input between devices, but apparently configure the keyboard to send appropiate keyboard functions to your operating system. This switching is done by holding down Fn+Q/W/E.
The backlighting is documented but appears to raise a lot of questions. It"s a bit confusing as it only seems to work 100% consistently when the keyboard has an active Bluetooth connection:
The "Lightbulb" key, bottom right, toggles on/brighter/off.
Hold down the lightbulb key and press the up/down arrows to change colour.
The keyboard does not seem to recall the colour when powered off, so it has to be reselected.
The lighting seems to turn off when the keyboard is not used for about a minute, but comes back on with its previous colour and brightness the next time a key is pressed.
The "Command" key is the equivalent of the "Windows" key, BTW.
The keyboard does not seem to persist between devices: that"s to say, if you connect it to a device initially you need to enter a code shown on the device"s screen. If you then connect to another device, you need to enter a code. Here"s the thing: when you reconnect to the first device again, you need to enter a code once more. For those intending a regular swap between devices, this is inconvenient.
The keyboard charges via USB but cannot be connected as a wired keyboard. This is true of most Bluetooth keyboards, but is unfortunate: I"m sure many people would find it useful.
I have used this keyboard with iOS, an Android 7 Samsung Galaxy S7, and a Windows desktop with a generic Bluetooth 4.0 dongle (and the dongle"s supplied drivers). No dongle is supplied with the keyboard.', '2018-11-14T19:32:54+00:00', '2', 'false', '3445', '47') ;

Most importantly, the keyboard feels good to use - don"t get me wrong, it"s not as good as those you"d find on a mac or Surface Pro, but they"re in a whole different price bracket.
It"s very easy to connect to a device, but it seems it can only be paired with one device at a time. If you want to use it with a second device, you have to pair that one, and then pair it once again when you switch back to the first device. If you want to use it with multiple devices frequently, this may not be the keyboard for you. The Bluetooth connection is very strong and I"ve yet to have an instance of it dropping out, and there is almost no lag between the key press and the letter appearing on the screen.
There are Android, Win and iOS buttons, which when pressed in conjunction with the Fn key, adapts certain keys to that particular operating system.
Battery life appears to be superb and is easy and quick to charge. A nice touch is the backlight, which isn"t common at this price point. There are 2 levels of brightness and the colour can be changed by holding down the lightbulb button and using the up and down cursors. Unfortunately, each time you turn off the keyboard it reverts to the red colour, regardless of your previous selection.
Although not a full-size keyboard, it"s big enough to use comfortably and, as you can see from the photos, is almost exactly the same size as a standard iPad. Personally, I purchased it to use, and often carry with, a 12.9" iPad Pro and, as you can see, it fits neatly into the document wallet on the protective case I have for it, making the keyboard perfect for working away from the home/office. (Apologies for the poor image quality, I only had the camera on my laptop with me when writing this).
Whilst the plastic construction makes it lightweight, it also makes it quite easy to twist it - it would have been nice if it felt a little more sturdy. Overall though, a great keyboard at a great price.

After checking online and other reviews, I was able to find out how to change the LED colours. It may have been said multiple times already, but no harm in throwing it out there again. Pressing the bulb once turns it on and pressing it a second time turns the colours brighter.
== Hold the bulb button then use the up and down arrow keys to change the backlight colours ==
After a few minutes, the backlight will disappear to save power which can be easily switched back on again.
NOTE: Backlights will only actively stay on when the keyboard is connected to a device. If it is not, the backlights will not turn on apart from the small moment from where the keyboard is turned off and on.
I have attached three pictures of the different variations of the 7 colours available.
Very easy to set up, just turned the keyboard on and clicked "connect" and it instantly appeared in my nearby Bluetooth devices and connected without any problems. I was able to move up to 10m away without any connection issues solely for testing the bluetooth range which is brilliant. Starting getting a bit hazy after 15m away.

It"s small and compact with backlit keys. Again, this was important because it would be used in a darkened bedroom. The Bluetooth range seems fine too and there does not seem to be any lag or delay between key pressing.
It"s doesn"t feel very robust if I"m honest. It feels a little cheap. If you are used to using a decent quality keyboard you will notice a difference to the keys. They do feel slightly slack and spongy. But, it does do the job and, for the cost and purpose, it does manage quite well.
The colour of the backlit keys can be changed as can the brightness.
It"s easy to use and simple to recharge too. Just plug the cable into the keyboard and a spare USB port (located to the rear of our TV) and it charges fine. It lasts quite a while too although I don"t use it continuously for hours on end. I use it as and when I need to type a little text or navigate around Steam Link.

The real let down is the trackpad, it is frustratingly awful.  For example,  if you have a lot to type, say hours of stuff to get through, by the end of it, the trackpad starts to lose sensitivity and becomes horribly jerky when scrolling and then eventually loses it"s ability to use the tap to click function.  It took me a while to figure out that the only way to fix this was to remove the batteries for a few seconds and that seemed to do the trick until the next time.
While the trackpad is working as it should, there are a couple of bizarre behaviors that sealed it"s fate with me.  The two finger scroll works well on some things and others it is jerky and not very accurate.  It also seems to get confused between two finger scrolling and pinch to zoom.  You will be scrolling down a word document and it then starts to zoom in and out without even touching it!  There"s a distinct lag between pinching to zoom and anything happening, meaning that accurate zooming is not easily achieved.

It was advertised for use when connecting a laptop to a television and the user being sat far away on a sofa needing a wireless device to control the PC from across the room.

I have been using the K400 keyboards since they very first came out, this is my third! The second is still working but the first died when the battery overflowed. Shame on you Duracell!
I have tried a wide range of media keyboards and these are the best. They have a great range, are ultra reliable and use very little power indeed.
The latest release they have moved the volume controls to a location above the trackpad which really is an excellent improvement. Overall there it’s a little larger, but hardly noticeable.

Just a shade lighter in colour now ~ dark grey instead of black. Quality does not feel quite the same as it did, now feeling a bit lighter and flimsier, but still OK.
The K400’s greatest feature is the amount of time the batteries last. Most other media keyboards last months. Using two AA batteries, these last years. I mean I use mine every single day and it’s two years between battery changes!
One really excellent new feature is that the K400 plus is supported by Logitech Options and you should download that software from Logitech. It allows you to configure tap, double tap and two finger operations on the track-pad. Personally I just disable them all, but am really thankful to be able to do so! You can also disable such things as the special functions on the function keys. You can also adjust sensitivity of the track-pad, although I have to say it didn"t seem to make much difference.
I have two complaints, but neither enough to take away a star ~
The first is that they are heavily influenced by the proximity of a human! Even place the keyboard on your knee and it may well stop working. This is just caused by poor reception by the receiver. There is a solution to this but Logitech should supply it as standard and they don’t. Buy one of these..
“StarTech.com Desktop USB Extension Cable”
( Or similar ) Position the receiver in away from the metal box of the PC and that improves reception so much that it counteracts the effect of getting the keyboard too close to your body.
Oh, and last minute third complaint is that they keyboard isn’t lit! Of course Logitech do a backlit version ~ the K830, but that will chew through batteries ( or charges ) a lot faster so it’s a trade-off. The K830 is also a lot more expensive. Buuuut, if you do a lot of typing in subdued lighting you may want to consider the K830 instead.
Don"t even think about it! Buy one. Or a K830. They are both amazing.', '2018-09-15T19:32:54+01:00', '0', 'false', '360', '58') ;

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('617', 'This keyboard APPEARS to be very well made, & APPEARS to be unused, but as for how it actually works, & how long it lasts remains to be seen, so more about that below.
I got it yesterday Wednesday 14 Nov (delivered by Hermes) from Amazon for £24.99. Delivered within about 24 hrs as I am a "Prime" customer.
As usual some delivery companies employees DO NOT treat the items they deliver with any respect at all! since the AMAZON beige box it arrived in looked like it had been squashed by something very heavy, as did the Logitech branded packaging inside the AMAZON packaging, that actually contained the keyboard. The "yellow sticker" I have seen attached to this keyboard in youtube videos was NOT there, making me think that this keyboard may well be a SECOND HAND OR USED and RETURNED and resold as new item, especially considered the very poor condition of both the exterior AMAZON packaging & the LOGITECH branded box.
When I pay for a NEW item I expect to get a NEW item. The battery life will probably reveal how old this item actually is since the batteries are supposed to last 18 months.
Use with Sony Bravia Androud TV:
In use (with a Sony 4k Android TV) it MOSTLY works as it should since it allows you to type letters for search much faster. It does not have a microphone button, but does not need one, since the Sony Remote has the Google Voice Assistant button.
You will find that even when typing with this keyboard (the virtual keyboard still shows on screen) SOME functions (like ENTER) will not work properly (while viewing OPERA web browser pages), since you still need to use either the TV remote or the keyboard arrow buttons, to get the SAME item you want to click on (which IS highlighted when you get there with the trackpad, becuase the enter button still does NOT function in this scenario).
This also means that the "suggested" words that appear above the virtual keyboard will also NOT be selectable via the enter button if you highlight them by moving the cursor to them with the trackpad.
This keyboard allows the arrow/cursor to be moved around VERY quickly AND SMOOTHLY with ONE finger, BUT to scroll properly in web pages, you still have to either use the TV remote or arrow buttons on the keyboard to move THE SAME CURSOR to the bottom of the tv screen.
When scrolling with two fingers DOES work it scrolls far too quickly in big jumps so either move your fingers VERY slowly, with scrolling still being VERY jerky or don"t bother.
Therefore scrolling with TWO fingers DOES NOT WORK properly & only very erratically, since most of the time the trackpad does NOT react with two finger use, anyway.
Also, this keyboard is a bluetooth item (as is the TV) but you still need to use the dongle for the TV to recognise the keyboards existence.
When viewing the Sony Android TV interface, you CAN SEE AND MOVE the cursor around the screen, but enter does NOT work to select an item hovered over, because that item us NOT highlighted - therefore the Remote or keyboard arrow buttons have to be used.
Use with Fire TV devices:
If you try to use this keyboard with a 2nd Generation Fire TV device, it WILL work up to a point WITHOUT using the dongle. e.g. you can see a cursor on ANY screen including the home screen, but again the enter button will NOT select ANYTHING.
Still WITHOUT using the dongle the keyboard arrow buttons WILL highlight items on the Fire TV home screen interface AND will get to "settings" items, but NOTHING can be selected.
This Fire TV device is a bluetooth device, but it will NOT find the keyboard, so you still HAVE to use thr dongle for better functionality.
However TYPING DOES WORK, but WITHOUT the dongle the ENTER button does NOT work, at all.
When typing with this keyboard the virtual keyboard does still appear on screen.
When the dongle IS used then Enter WILL work (erratically).
BUT the trackpad then DOES NOT, so you no longer see a "cursor" and will HAVE to use the keyboard arrow buttons or "Alexa Voice Remote to move around the Fire TV screen interface.
When using a browser (like Firefox) with Fire TV, you DO see a smaller grey circle cursor as well as the big blue one, and you can move this little grey cursor - with the trackpad - but there is little point doing so since Enter will NOT work when hoverimg over an item with the grey cursor - you STILL have to use the keyboard arrow buttons or the Alexa Voice Remote, to highlight any item or link before you can select it with the enter button.
The upshot of all this leaves me with questions:
1) Even though this keyboard (when dongle is or is not inserted), DOES have a small amount of cursor control via the trackpad, there is little point in this trackpad being there since very little is highlighted or even selectable with the enter or mouse buttons.
2) The volume & mute buttons above the trackpad DO work (with the Sony TV).
3) Why does a bluetooth enabled Sony 4k Android TV NOT detect this bluetooth keyboard without the dongle?
4) Why do I still need to use the dongle for the BLUETOOTH Keyboard to work, either erratically or NOT work at all with bluetooth enabled devices?
4) Why is SOME control possible of a Fire TV device, WITHOUT using the dongle?
5) Why does the trackpad of this keyboard show a cursor on the Sony Android TV user home interface (when using the dongle) & on the Fire TV user home interface (when NOT using the dongle), but still does not allow "proper mouse control" including the use of "selection" function via mouse buttons or enter whichever device I try to use this keyboard with?
6) Why is it that - when USING the dongle - that I can use the trackpad (ONLY in Firefox for Fire TV) but I then see TWO cursors (& the little grey one does NOT highlight links or items).?', '2018-11-16T19:32:54+00:00', '1', 'false', '360', '56') ;

It worked previously at about 8m range. Suddenly stopped working at anything other than 3m, making it quite useless. This was remedied by using a 1.5m USB extension lead. Strangley, even keeping it in relatively the same place through the lead is making it work. But plugging directly doesn"t. So don"t know what"s happening. Changing batteries didn"t do anything either. Knocking off a star for that.
Setting this up was very easy. Just plug the receiver into a USB port, turn the Keyboard to on position, and Windows did the rest. No other pairing or any of that nonsense was required. It"s plug and play. Uses 2.4GHz radio instead of Bluetooth. Used in a USB hub behind the computer where there are lot"s of other electrically noisy bits and bobs, and it works without issues. It even works in BIOS, so it is a true driverless keyboard. It works instantaneously after being switched on and off and on again.
Tried at a range of about 8 meters. The left mouse click button on the top left is very useful and well thought.
The F keys only function whilst holding down the FN button because they double as function keys. It would have been much better if it required a press, rather than a hold. The media keys do not do much unless you install the Logitech software.
There are no indicators for Caps Lock or Num Lock. This can be resolved by installing the software which will then give you an onscreen message to tell you that the keys are engaged, but there is no light. This is done to preserve battery life, but really just how much battery is a small light that isn"t even always on going consume?
The on/off switch is located at the top back of the device. It"s not as robust as I would have liked. Feels a bit floppy. but it functions.
As media keyboard it"s mostly at night with the lights low watching a video or playing a game away from the monitor and on the TV. This means the keys are difficult to see. That"s not a fault of the device, but if it"s going to be used in that sort of environment you might be better off getting a small illuminated keyboard.

Each key, when pressed, meets a very spongy, rubbery mat under the keys, allowing the keys to travel to such a depth that when a finger is moved to another key, it catches on the edge of one of the surrounding keys.
Tapping on the touch-pad produces a hollow clunking sound along with the rattling.

It has a stupid vertical home / end / pg up layout. Why, Perixx?

Then, I decided to join the PCMR and get a keyboard with mechanical switches. Cue Cherry MX Blues, etc etc. I first had a Corsair K70, then a Razer BlackWidow Tournament Edition. But the thing was... ...wires. And I wanted to be able to switch between my Windows environment and my Raspberry Pi without a problem. And perhaps my Android phone too (yes, I really, really ditched Apple).
Now that I"ve "moderated" a little bit, I discovered the Logitech MX Anywhere 2S mouse. And then, days later, I was encouraged to buy this beauty. This is not a gaming keyboard by any stretch, but the keys are as good as the ones on my Lenovo ThinkPad T480S, and that"s saying an awful lot. They make a lovely noise which is dampened slightly by the hard rubber. The alphanumeric keys are concave, whilst the fn keys and modifier keys are convex.
The pressure feels just right. There is no plastiky feel. As I said, this really feels every bit as good as a ThinkPad keyboard. The keys feel responsive, but not to the point they feel unstable. The key travel is about as long as you would get on an Apple Wireless keyboard, but when the keys hit the end of their travel it just feels... ...nice. You want to keep typing. That"s why this review has gone on for so long.
Now to the rubber stand bit. I like it, it doesn"t get used much, but it sure is a nice visual feature. The rubber gives the keyboard a whacky weight to it. You could hit someone and jolly well hurt them with this thing. It"s rubber, but it"s not tacky. It feels incredibly good quality. This is like a ThinkPad keyboard mixed with a little modernity.

I have found that typing is so much easier on this. The keys are really well spaced out, and typing is just a pleasure now; no more hammering on the keyboard.  The keys have a great feel when depressed.
The keyboard also looks really nice.  I didn"t really buy it for the phone/tablet stand - but it does work well.  I got it purely cos it was the best looking keyboard Logitech make at the moment - I think - plus it had really good reviews.
It has taken a few days to adjust to some of the key placements; some keys are in slightly different positions than they were on my old keyboard, but that will probably be a similar problem when moving between most keyboards.

Solution: This fantastic bit of kit, the K780. I was a bit wary of buying an "expensive" keyboard without trying it but it has a great feel and is as good as my benchmark keyboard on the Dell 1525. The keystrokes are short, positive and silent but the keyboard is so slim and solidly constructed (I think it might be solid aluminium) that the key impact noise transfers through to the desk instead. I would recommend something like a rubber mouse mat underneath to completely kill the noise.
I love this keyboard for its round keys which are very easy to hit correctly and for the ease of switching between laptops. I have one laptop on wireless using the dongle, the other on Bluetooth. I did set up the third channel for my mobile by Bluetooth but it doesn"t save much time as most mobile operations are pressing or swiping, it might be useful if you were blogging or doing something that involved a long tying session. I also bought a Logitech switchable mouse, again one laptop wireless via dongle, the other via Bluetooth. The downloaded software detected two receiver dongles and asked if I wanted to combine them onto one which it then did for me. Very easy and freed up a USB port.
Solid recommendation. One possible downside is the width of the "gutter" to support a phone or tablet, I think this is only about 11mm and my slim Huawei only just fits when it is in a case. Not a problem for me as I don"t use it but if this a reason for buying then beware.', '2019-03-27T19:32:54+00:00', '0', 'false', '4067', '16') ;

Typing Experience: The keyboard is quiet, comfortable and accurate. It has a reasonable amount of depth in key presses and the spacing between the keys is good. The rounded design of the keys seems to provide some added assurance for accurate typing (albeit it may be psychological).
Design: It looks good and has bit of weight due to the back panel which supports a tablet/phone. It doesn"t shift around on the desk and the black/white contrast is fine with a granite style design. No back lighting but not really a big deal as the model offering that feature is over x3 the price! Also has a num-pad which was needed.
Multi-Device: I can"t comment on the functionality as I have yet to use this with another PC or operating system but the setup on the Mac was straight forward to connect via Bluetooth.
Functions: Most Mac specific shortcuts are available although you may need to go through the online guide to find some more obscure options such as adjusting the brightness of the screen via the keyboard. Logitech options gives you a little bit more functionality. For example, there is no caps lock indicator on the keyboard or on screen but this can be made available via the software.

It has a standard UK layout, hotkeys and function keys alongside arrow keys and a numpad (all in standard positions).
As it"s a USB keyboard, you simply need to plug it in (no batteries, just one wire you plug into the USB port on your computer). It was very fast to get set up. Your computer should quickly recognise that a new device has been plugged in and you should be able to use it right away. This all worked perfectly, and I was able to get going quickly.
The keys are not clunky and noisy like some keyboards, but instead feel much more distinguished and soft. There is still some noise though, so if you like a whisper-quiet keyboard, this may not be for you.
I have large hands and my partner has small hands; we are both happily able to use this keyboard without any problems. There is ample gap in between each key to avoid hitting multiple keys when typing at speed, and the spacing is very very similar to the Microsoft keyboard this was bought to replace - so re-learning the key positions was not necessary.

The hotkeys work with my Windows 10 machine.
Nice, slightly curved, profile allows for a small rake to the keys which helps to pick them out.
Seems very sturdy and advertises spill-resistance - which I believe is true.
Rear stands to adjust the angle of the keyboard up to around 4.5cm at the back.
Soft keys with not too much noise.
USB connection - quick to get set up.
CON:
Could provide more options for keyboard rake on adjustable stands (forward tilt).
Quite chunky (not slimline)
An exceptionally good keyboard for the price.', '2018-10-04T19:32:54+01:00', '2', 'false', '4308', '45') ;

I"m an office administrator and at work I need a keyboard so I can comfortably type while still being more than arm"s length from my laptop. This was a perfect answer! Long cable, quiet keys that don"t click suitable for office work, soft press keys that are very easy on the fingers/wristsand not so small they are difficult to press or so big they are awkwardly spaced etc. It has kept very well over the last five months, being heavily used nine hours a day five days a week, none of the letters have rubbed off and all keys are still accounted for. I bought a previous cheap keyboard from eBay but it had keys in places other than where they were labelled, some just didn"t work, they were loose, loud and took several pressed sometimes to make work right from brand new. This is completely the other end of the spectrum, everything works, smartly packaged instead of just tape and bubble wrap, high quality and all keys are properly and accurately mapped out. Very good quality considering it is at the very low end of the budget for keyboards.
Postage was very prompt and for the money it was a great price. May not be suitable for gaming if you want programmable keys as there are none, it"s very easy to use at work and take wherever you like as it"s USB connection. Black and white design makes it look very smart on my desk and it"s been so hard wearing that if it broke tomorrow I"d just buy another one. It may not be what you want for a home computer if you"re looking for flashing lights, custom keys and clacking mechanical keys but it"s been a great addition to my desk.

I wasn"t looking for anything other than a basic keyboard that would last me a good few years, and thought that a Microsoft product would do just that. I have no need for wireless connectivity or a special gaming keyboard, so this has been absolutely ideal.
You basically get what you would expect; a plug and play USB connected keyboard with the very basic of keys that should last you a number of years. There are a few special keys in the form of a play, pause and volume button, which is a bonus, but apart from that, there is no unnecessary bells and whistles. The keys feel responsive, cushioned and comfortable, which creates less noise when typing than keyboards I"ve used in the past. All in all a great and essential buy.
If for what ever reason I did need another new keyboard in the future, I would go for this one again in a heartbeat. Considering the price and durability it has been a great purchase. 5 Stars.

Installation was a breeze with a USB port for simple plug and play and Windows 10 had no trouble detecting the keyboard. It also has a number of useful media and shortcut keys along the top

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('651', 'I got this on Amazon for £9.99. For the money, its an absolute steal. The build quality is significantly better than my old  Logitech (MK270 at £24.99) in a few ways: first, everything is built solidly meaning the keys don"t rattle at all. On my Logitech if I shook the keyboard, you"d hear the keys jiggle around. This Microsoft 600 Keyboard doesn"t do that. Second, the overall design seems to have not much cost cutting, the bottom of the device is solid plastic unlike the Logitech which had flimsy plastic and tons of cutout holes. And finally, the Microsoft keyboard has large rubber feet molded into the bottom of the keyboard (not just glued-on rubber pads that eventually come off).
The only flaw in the keyboard so far is the raisers don"t have rubber grips, so while the keyboard grips decently to the desk, the raisers are a bit slidey.
This is not a mechanical keyboard, it is just a membrane one - so don"t expect the best typing experience ever known, but if you are used to membrane keyboards like I am, then this is just more of the same. Function keys are small, so that may take some getting used to. The media controls are a nice addition too. And the keyboard also has SCRL/CAPS/NUM lock LED indicators. The top right of the keyboard has a nice shiny Microsoft logo (I think painted/printed on - maybe it will wear down over time).
I got the "White" variant, and while the pictures show a more greyish tone; they are deceiving. The keyboard really is white. While I was hoping for it to be greyish, I"m actually happy with the white. Its really nice and clean looking and blends nicely into my white desk. The wire and USB plug are also white. The keyboard is just plug in and go. Windows instantly recognizes it and it"s working within a couple of seconds.
Overall, this is a very affordable keyboard and is surprisingly high quality. I imagine this keyboard will be durable and hopefully it will last many many years. [I"ll update this review if it breaks.]', '2018-11-18T19:32:54+00:00', '1', 'false', '4308', '23') ;

Logitech have changed the design - it is very similar but not the same. I have included a pic. I bought this because the layout was identical to my MacBook. Not any more! What a shame. Still a good keyboard, but not quite the gem I hoped it would be. In its favour - a LOT cheaper than the mac keyboard! I"m going to give it a go.
In summary: This is a great PC bluetooth keyboard that is also OK for mac.
* The enter key is now bigger. Not a major issue - its a bigger target than on the MacBook! The cost has been to displace the back slash key to the row below. Not a commonly used key for me.
* The key to the left of the number 1 is now the same as a PC keyboard and not a mac keyboard. For a mac it outputs § - not sure of the purpose of that.
* The key that was previously there has been moved to the left of the Z key. That key also now being like a PC keyboard. Make it much more difficult to toggle when used with cmd.
* The result of that move is to have the shift key on the left to shrink. Again - more typical of PC keyboard.
* (mac) option+3 = # (this is not printed on the keyboard.
+ Really well made. Much like all of the Logitech bluetooth keyboards I have encountered.
+ The "del" works like a PC del key - for a mac user that is very welcome.
+ Great rubber feet.
+ Bluetooth pairing is painless - unlike the previous Logitech keyboard that I owned.
+ Switching works REALLY well between my apple devices.
+ Nice key action.
- The circular keys take a little getting used to but I got there in the end. Still not 100% convinced by them.
- The greyed out mac commands on shared function keys are almost invisible.
- The power key on the left hand side rattles if you knock it. It is the loudest sound on this keyboard. I tend to rest my little finger there - so I do knock it from time to time. It"s a minor thing.
- No light on caps lock. It doesn"t activate the MacBook"s caps lock light either. But, again, a minor irritation.
- That small left shift key.', '2018-07-24T19:32:54+01:00', '2', 'false', '4759', '8') ;

Whenever I want to use it with other devices, I have to disconnect from the previous device it is connected.
This can be done but is very time consuming.
I am so delighted to find K380 which can be connected to up to 3 devices at the same time.
Three buttons on the left corner of the keyboard quickly changes the device it connects.
Key spacing and pressure is almost as same as Magic keyboard, which is great for people with small hands like myself.
The only difference is the angle. It is more flat than Magic keyboard.
I overcome this flatness by gluing a small felt pad for the furniture (see attached photoes).
I actually did the same thing for the Logitech touchpad T650 to make it same angle as Magic trackpad.
It worked great!
The added bonus was the extra friction from the felt pad gives more stability.

Although Logitech K380 is slightly more expensive than many other similar devices available on amazon, I found the Logitech K380 quality, lack of lag and ability to swiftly re-establish connection making it distinctly superior to the various other brands I have tried this far (Literally tried 7 other brands, each eventually displaying various issues including intermittent connection problems so were all evidently returned).
I am currently using this keyboard with my Macbook Pro 13 Retina (Mid 2014 model) under both OSX and Windows 7 (Bootcamp). The keyboard displays the ability to pair with 3 different bluetooth devices making it easy to switch between them using a simple press of either F1, F2 or F3 (buttons are yellow in the image).
I initially purchased the keyboard when writing up my final year dissertation project and needed a device that was as good and fast as the native built in keyboard on my macbook (with ofcourse lacking cables) allowing my macbook to be linked with an external monitor and for me to sit back in a relaxed position to type. The Logitech K380 lived up to my expectations.
Pros:
- Displays a high quality, well built feel.
- Easy to setup and use.
- Relatively small overall size but with a standard keyboard layout (similar to a macbook pro)
- Has the ability to connect and control up to 3 different bluetooth devices.
- Long battery life – Batteries are included! (Logitech claims up to 2 years – however I can confirm with high use, batteries still going strong after 6 months of use).
- Keyboard has built in sleep feature to save on power and appears to re-establish connection within 2-3 seconds.
Cons:
- Relatively more expensive than several other similar devices.
- Battery powered device (many other brands are now provide the ability to recharge the device).
- Keys are circular and do take a little bit of getting used to.', '2018-10-07T19:32:54+01:00', '1', 'false', '4759', '37') ;

Pros:
- Great size in a medium/small desk setting. I have average sized hands and it"s easy to speed type on.
- The keys have a satisfying conviction, and no wobble - so no mistyping at all.
- I can easily switch in a second between 3 devices. Easy to mix work and personal gadget typing quickly.
- Dual OS works flawlessly.
- Zero lag on either W10 or OSX.
- Solid weight + rubber feet, this thing won"t budge easily.
- All the function keys work on your phone (music play/pause/volume & Ringer level)
Cons:
- Not the most stylish keyboard, but the Matte grey is a nice colour if you have other "Space Grey" items.

My only gripe is that the choice of device is made using the first 3 function keys, which also have uses in an audio editing programme I use regularly. The button presses to access the F1-F3 functions are annoyingly cumbersome when trying to work fast - but it is a minor inconvenience.
As a design suggestion for the Mark2 version - I would suggest that Logitech leave the tiny LED light - above the button which denotes which device you are connected to - permanently on otherwise it is easy to forget and start typing into the wrong device.  The lights currently turn on when you select the new device but then turn off after 5 seconds.

I bought this particular keyboard because of the facility to pair with 3 devices and switch the keyboard between them by pressing a button, thereby eliminating the need to carry multiple keyboards with me when I travel.
Delivery was prompt and the keyboard arrived intact and well-packaged.
The keyboard has a satisfying weight and solid feel to it. Unlike some of the cheaper models I"ve bought in the past. Pairing with each of my devices was a breeze, and switching between them is fiendishly easy! it has "dual keys" which recognise the device you are paired with and functions accordingly (the grey symbols relate to Apple, the white to Microsoft/Android I believe). I"ve had no issues with this. The size of the keyboard, spacing of keys etc is compact, but not cramped. I have yet to have an issue mis-hitting keys because of their location.
it is on the pricey side, and I would have given it an even higher rating if it came with its own sleeve or cover (hence the 4, not 5 stars), however, my first impressions (I"ve only had it a few days) are that it will give me many years of service.

Plus she has the Note tablet"s bespoke 
 for rapid handwritten note-taking and tablet control. And she does type & write tablet words faster than I can type with this Logitech K380 keyboard. However she did get this Logitech K380 keyboard in 
 to try with her 10" tablet and we were both quite impressed with it. The keyboard works with PC"s as well, which can be handy as a remote if a Bluetooth enabled laptop is playing a movie in the distance. So when I purchased my large 13" 
 tablet I decided that this K380 keyboard would be a perfect functional compliment to the 13" screen tablet (and it is - it also looks good in dark grey and it was a few pounds cheaper than the blue coloured K380 as well). The keyboard was easily paired with my Yoga 2 Tablet, the Galaxy Note 10.1 and my Nexus 7 tablet (you can pair and remember three devices).  Once paired the keyboard just works when the tablet comes on - and that was surprisingly useful if like my daughter you have a long complicated password for your login screen (the alternative old style telephone keypad keyboard being particularly horrible to use). I didn"t think the lack of an inbuilt stand for the tablet was a problem as all our tablets have built in stands integrated into their official tablet cases or the tablet itself in the case of my Yoga 2 Pro. There"s no keyboard manual included but all the details (e.g. keyboard shortcuts) are on Logitech"s website as the "setup guide".
In use this K380 keyboard is naturally great for Office and internet chores, and in particular when editing number and text in Excel type spreadsheets within our Pro Office Suite Android app or editing text when you have the up/down left/right arrows and forward-delete. Plus of course it gives you a better view of the document screen when typing and editing a lot of text, as you don"t need the Android keyboard app overlaid on half of the screen. There"s eight double key shortcuts, e.g. Fn+C is copy, Fn+V is paste and Fn+X is cut. The top keys also function as media player controls where you can change track, adjust volume and mute sound at the touch of a button (sound control is the most useful as it means you don"t have to fumble with the tablet to press the volume control buttons). There"s also keys for menu, pause play, switch apps, home, and delete. And there"s the standard keyboard keys for things like tab, return, back-delete, shift, and cntrl, plus the normal four arrow directional keys. Both our tablets and my daughter"s Honor 6 smartphone run Android 4 (KitKat) and this keyboard works with Android 3 and above. There"s no click when you use the keyboard so it"ll be OK in lectures and meetings, although there is a slight tapping noise as you hit each key. The "laptop style" keyboard tile keys are fine with my large male hands and the keys seem positive enough (no miss-fires or doubles). Plus you naturally have the option of using the tablets touch screen in conjunction with the K380 keyboards character and navigation keys. With my 13" Yoga 2 Pro Tablet the whole setup has the feel of a large laptop without the weight (when used on a table/desk).
The keyboard has a rather stingy one year Logitech warranty and the batteries lasts "up to" 2 years (2 x AAA batteries supplied ready fitted). This K380 keyboard is far more useful than we thought it would be, and we can use it with our tablets as a remote control for media, so it sits around nearby ready to grab anytime when we are tableting. Overall it"s a hit and 4*, assuming it lasts a lot longer than the batteries. It"s not particularly light at 430g though, taking the combined tablet+keyboard weight to nearer 1.5 kg, but it is reasonably compact at 12.4 cm x 27.9 cm x 1.6cm for the backpack. Not an essential item for our tablets, but a useful addition none the less and my daughter now takes it to all her lectures. Plus it"s not too expensive at around £35. My daughters only complaints are that the keyboard is 3.5cm wider than her 10.1" tablet (so it looks ungainly with it - no problem with my 13" Yoga 2 Pro) and that she was taking the batteries out when it"s squashed into her carry bag/backpack, as it kept trying to pair with her tablet when she"s using it without the keyboard (we"ve since found the physical on/off switch on the side of the keyboard, so that"s no longer a problem). The Logitech keyboard packaging is such that it would be easy to repack the keyboard and return to Amazon for refund if you found you didn"t get on with it, provided you unpack it carefully. Logitech say the keyboard also works with Apple products like iPads, iPhones, PCs and the AppleTV. I"m very happy with this K380 keyboard, it only loses a star for the 1 year warranty although our blue version is over two years old now and still working fine.

I LOVE this keyboard so much. I can easily switch to different things like my Android phone and my pc. Because it uses Bluetooth over infrared I could even use it with my Amazon TV stick. No idea why more things don"t use Bluetooth - I specifically look for Bluetooth over anything else now.
The keyboard connects quickly as I"ve even used it right on the login screen when my other keyboard would take a good few mins to connect and then fail to connect.

The difference in the quality of the keyboards is remarkable. The keyboard on the Microsoft Wireless Desktop 2000 is dreadful. The entire thing flexes when used with the rear extensions raised, and the spacebar seems to be a total hit and miss, not always working, with a dreadful tinny click.
The mouse is also not the same as the one shipped with the Wireless Desktop 3000 (now called 3050). We also have a Microsoft Wireless Comfort Desktop 5050 which has the same Bluetrack  mouse as the 3050. The mouse that ships with the Desktop 2000 is not the same and feels a lot less substantial in the hand.

All of the standard keyboard keys will work without any additional software being installed. If you wish to use the additional customisable keys at the top of the keyboard, or reconfigure some of the other keyboard functions, it"s a simple case of downloading the Microsoft Keyboard and Mouse Center application from the Microsoft website and using the straightforward interface to tailor the keyboard to your needs.

Pros:
+ Comfortable and sturdy
+ Lots of extra buttons (volume +/-, calculator, e-mail, homepage, 5 user-defined favourites etc.)
+ Mouse works on almost any surface (leather couch armrest, jeans, wooden floor, glass tabletop)
Cons:
- No forward/back buttons on mouse
- No mute button beside volume controls
- Dongle is quite big; inconvenient for use with laptops
- All the (sometimes) useful extra buttons take room from "ESC" and "F" keys, meaning they seem unnecessarily small, which is annoying if using them often (e.g. Excel or certain games) They also don"t have the traditional gaps between F4 & F5 and F8 & F9
The cons may seem insignificant - and to some I"m sure they are - but since this is a newer model than the set I was replacing, I wasn"t really expecting them to take a couple of steps backwards by removing useful things. The mute button is no big deal but the lack of extra buttons on the mouse seems like a major oversight.

INSERT INTO message (id, content, created_at, report_counter, blocked, id_product, id_non_admin) VALUES ('681', 'I"ve wanted a decent wireless keyboard and mouse for months.  The last time I bought one, which was several years ago, the Logitech unit I ended up with was one of the worst keyboards I"ve ever used and I was anxious not to end up in the same situation.  I narrowed it down to this, the Microsoft Wireless Desktop 3000 (which seems to have more features but is the same price...weird) and an Anker wireless keyboard/mouse bundle.
It arrived bent out of shape, so one corner of the keyboard was higher than the other...a bit like when a table has a wonky leg.  A little brute force to bend the entire plastic casing a little and it was almost as good as new, so I could type without the entire keyboard tilting back and forth.  Not a great start, but all"s well that ends well.  Both keyboard and mouse come with branded batteries which is good, with the mouse using 2 x AAs and the keyboard using 2 x AAAs; the 2 AAs in the mouse makes it nicely weighted.
The mouse is decent, fairly comfortable and the plastic casing doesn"t feel too cheap.  The scroll wheel is smooth (i.e. you can"t feel tiny ridges as you turn the wheel, like you can with some other mice...personally, I prefer this) but "stiff" enough to be completely controllable.  The wheel can also be clicked down, left and right (all of which appear to be configurable).
The keyboard is also pretty decent.  It has a wrist rest which works but is made of hard, cheap feeling plastic (as is the entire keyboard).  The keys are non-mechanical so are soft and reasonably quiet (apart from the space bar, which makes much more noise than every other key).  You can configure all the function keys but you have to then use the Fn key to activate the custom function.  It would be nice to be able to set this on or off and I think you can do this with the 3000 version of this set.  There are also several soft-keys which you can assign functions without having to use another key combination; these are useful but very stiff to press...much, much more so than the other keys.  It could simply be because it"s new but only time will tell.
Now the not so good...
The mouse feels too small.  I"ve always used one of the old Microsoft Intellimouse units until now and I suppose the new wireless mouse will take a bit of getting used to; it"s shorter than my old corded Intellimouse which (at the moment, at least) feels awkward.
There"s no getting away from the fact the the keyboard feels cheap.  There"s an abundance of single use and customisable keys which to me are just gimmicks.  Do I really need a key whose sole purpose is to open the Windows calculator?  Probably not.  One of the worst things about this keyboard is the keys" decals are very reflective.  This means that if you have overhead lighting (such as halogen downlighters), it"s very difficult to see some of the decals, dependent on where the light falls, because they reflect the light back into your eyes.  During the day or with ambient light, it"s fine but something to bear in mind.
