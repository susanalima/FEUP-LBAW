This review was written on the keyboard itself.\nBUILD QUALITY\nThe keyboard is precision engineered, I didn't find anything loose, keys out of place or even askew. It's built solidly with care and precision. The keyboard weight is quite high and I find it difficult to re-orientate it using only my pinky fingers on either side while typing but this adds to its solid feeling construction.\nThe main typing chassis has very minor flex, considering how thin it is and that's made from plastic I'm impressed. While typing there is no flexing at all, it just feels solid and sturdy.\nTHE TYPING EXPERIENCE\nI purchased this keyboard because I really like chiclet style keyboards. If you've used an Apple laptop or desktop keyboard in the last 10 years it feels a lot like those but with a deeper actuation point so the keys can go down a little further. The important thing is, it feels great to type on. All the keys are consistent in the amount of force needed to actuate them with a satisfying key bounce.\nThe indentations on the key surfaces were something that concerned me before I received the keyboard as in the photos they look quite deep into the keys. But in reality it's quite subtle and not easily visible from a sitting position, under the finger the indentations feel quite nice, almost like the keys conform to your finger tips. I would go so far as to say I prefer the indentation chiclet keys to the non-indentation type.\nOne thing this keyboard doesn't suffer from is wobbly keys. I don't know what mechanism Logitech is using but I'd assume it's a two point scissor switch. You can press a key right on its very corner and it will still go down evenly, all the keys feel incredibly sturdy and solid. They also have almost no movement side to side which is nice.\nOverall the typing experience is great, if you like chiclet style keyboards this is one of if not the best example of a chiclet implementation I've seen.\nTHE KEYBOARD BACK LIGHTING\nOne of the reasons I purchased this keyboard was because of the back lighting, not because I wanted the lighting but because it means the key letters are not printed so they cant rub off after a couple of years of use. The middle part of the keys I believe are laser etched and the lighting shines through very brightly.\nYou can control the intensity of the light and on the maximum brightness mode it is much brighter than other back light keyboards I've seen including Apples Retina MacBook Pro. There is a lot of back light bleed around the edges of the keys which I believe is due to them using a single light source for the entire keyboard to save battery but it still looks great with each key shining evenly and clearly.\nThe back lighting on the keyboard can be used while not plugged in and charging but it will automatically dim if your hands move away from the keyboard using some kind of proximity sensor. If you have it plugged in to charge you can keep the wireless lighting on permanently.\nPersonally I would have liked some control over how soon the lights dim when you stop typing as it feels a bit too soon for me. Also while the back light does slowly turn on and off it could be slowed further so it's less noticeable when it occurs. At first I found the lighting turning off constantly to be distracting but I have since gotten used to it and no longer notice.\nTHE WIRELESS FEATURE\nThe wireless on the keyboard works solidly with both the included unifying receiver (USB Type A, very small receiver) and also with the built in Bluetooth. I've tried the keyboard with a PC using the unifying receiver and a Mac using Bluetooth and it works really well with both, I found no issues of any kind with the wireless signal it at no time lost connection to either machine while I used it.\nThe keyboard does feature a multi-connect system, there are three keys above insert, home and page up which enable you to instantly switch the keyboard between three devices. These can be Bluetooth devices like a Computer, Tablet or Smart Phone or devices using the unifying receiver. I found this feature not only works perfectly but is instantaneous.\nTHE BATTERY LIFE\nLogitech states the battery lasts a week but I found this to be false. For me the battery lasts about 3 days with back lighting active. The good news is you can still use the keyboard while it's plugged in and charging. The keyboard is supplied with a USB-A to USB-C cable with the USB-C side plugging into the keyboard for charging.\nThe battery life can be extended greatly if you choose to disable the lighting but it looks really great with the back lighting on and certainly easier to use with it turned on.\nTHE CREATIVE INPUT DIAL\nPerhaps the first time a keyboard has come with a built in fidget device the wheel in the top left is supposed to be the keyboards stand out feature but I personally found its functionality to be quite basic and it feels like a novelty. I am a heavy Photoshop user and although it offers integration with Photoshop CC the things it enables you to do can be done quite quickly with the mouse or a pen input device like a Wacom tablet so its usefulness is suspect.\nOne area where I thought the input dial would shine is when changing the brush size dynamically while drawing a line in Photoshop but that's not the case because you can only adjust the brush size with the dial when you're not holding down your mouse cursor. This is a big disappointment for me. I'd gladly buy the keyboard at a lower price without the input dial entirely.\nAnother issue with the input dial is the noise it makes when changing modes. By default it will scroll without any resistance but when you activate a program profile that needs to provide \"bumps\" in the turning of the wheel, for example changing volume on a Mac or switching Tabs in Chrome it will make a very audible click sound as it engages some kind of gear inside the wheel. I found this to be quite annoying especially when you switch apps and you can hear it engaging and disengaging over and over each time you touch the wheel. Thankfully this \"switching\" functionality can be disabled but by doing so you're losing a main feature point of the keyboard.\nMy last issue with the wheel is how easy it is to touch it by accident when reaching for the esc key in the top left corner. There is very little space between the wheel and the esc key and when you touch the wheel it brings up a volume adjustment screen on your display and it's just annoying.\nINCLUDED SOFTWARE\nWhen I first plugged the unifying receiver into my PC (running Windows 10) it prompted me to download and install \"LogiOptions\" which appears to be the companion software for the keyboard from Logitech. This 149MB download allows you to customise the keyboards Input Dial on a per-application basis and also globally across all apps. It also allows you to customise the function keys along the top and a few other options such as permanently disabling the back light if desired. It also shows the battery life and the status of your unifying wireless adaptor if you use it.\nI believe this software also enables the third party integration between the input dial and apps like Photoshop. It can bring up overlays on the screen when you touch the input dial to indicate what tool you're adjusting by tapping, clicking or turning the dial. The interface is very clean and professional looking in-keeping with Windows 10 style cues.\nI found the software to be quite stable and easy to use, it does include an automatic updater built in which I also found easy to use with a minimal amount of effort needed to install new updates when presented to me by the interface.\nPRICE\nI feel the keyboard at £159.99 which is what I paid for it from Amazon is still asking a lot. The typing experience is stellar, the brightness of the back light is great. The wireless feature with the ability to still use the keyboard even while being charged is a nice touch and the included USB-C charging cable is good to see on a 2017 product but I feel it would be much more appropriately priced at £99.99.\nCONCLUSION\nI really like the keyboard for typing, I'd much rather buy a version without the click wheel for less money and I'd like to see them increase the battery capacity so you don't need to charge it as often.\nPositives:\n + Great typing experience\n + Really bright back lighting\n + Great keycaps that feel stable and enjoyable to press\n + Good well thought out key layout\n + Perfect choice and placement of all function/media keys along the top row\nCons:\n - Lack of control over back light proximity timeout\n - Creative Input Dial is mostly an expensive gimmick\n - Creative Input Dial is placed a bit too close to the esc key causing unintended dial touches\n - Battery life could be a lot better\n - Price: About 37% more than it should be."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"It's a nice keyboard I must say, looks good and is very nice to type with. The input dial is a complete gimmick, battery life is horrendous (2-3 days) and using it with Bluetooth on Windows 10 is a no-no (you are forced to use the dongle) as it completely incapacitate the Bluetooth drivers (you won't be able to connect to anything over Bluetooth until you fix the problem and stop using the keyboard over Bluetooth). I have done my research, and many have complained about this but Logitech are staying mute on the issue so I don't foresee this being resolved anytime soon, if ever. It's a  real pain if you have a tablet as I do and only one USB port. Typing experience is quite nice however, and the keyboard itself does look very good, so keeping it despites the flaws."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"This keyboard is absolutely brilliant, it feels like a premium bit of kit and is an absolute joy to type with. That said, although this is a keyboard you're not here to read about how it types are you? You want to know about the crown functionality! So let's leave that part for other reviewers to deal with and dive into how the crown has come into use in my day to day design life.\nFrom a technical standpoint the crown is pretty spectacular. The lightest of touches brings up the control menu, the way it satisfyingly clicks between free spin and ratcheted spin both sounds, and more importantly, feels sublime and it looks gorgeous too. Although, when I say the lightest of touches I really do mean the lightest of touches, it feels like even looking at the crown triggers the menu popping up, so expect to see it a few hundred times a day. Fortunately it's harder to actually accidentally trigger a change than it is to bring up the menu, so although you'll be spawning the menu accidentally you won't be randomly adjusting the brightness too often (but it WILL happen, probably when the CEO is at your desk).\nNow, when I was reading about this keyboard before purchasing I fantasised about how much time i would save with the crown, how it would revolutionise my workflow and would make me the world's greatest designer in a matter of seconds. The sad reality is that although I used it a fair bit the first week, by the end of the first month I was baring using it at all. I guess I'm just too accustomed to keyboard shortcuts and end up going into autopilot. I do still use it for some things, mainly skipping songs and changing the volume of music (there are volume and skip keys on the keyboard, but I gotta get use out of this crown some how!).\nSo it's not the design revolution I was hoping for, but it is a really cool bit of kit. If you forced yourself to use the crown and stuck with it then you probably could end up streamlining your workflow. But if you've been designing for years you'll probably only end up using the crown for a minimal amount of uses.\nSo why haven't I returned this keyboard? Because of that thing we don't really want to talk about - it's such a lovely typing experience. The key travel is perfect, as is the spacing and the click as you strike each key. It's truly a joy to type with.\nAlso I'll just touch on battery life because I've seen some conflicting reviews on this. I have the backlight turned off and go weeks and weeks without needing to charge the keyboard, so unless you're working in a cave you should just turn the backlight off and bask in the joy of forgetting where you left the charging lead."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"This is an absolute rubbish of a product from Logitech. Had to replace the first one because its battery did not work at all on arrival. Now received the replacement and it while its battery works it keeps on loosing Bluetooth connection with my iMac. Creates multiple Bluetooth sessions but fails to connect. Shameful from Logitech, very disappointed as a customer who used their products for many years."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"I was so excited about this keyboard yet it did not last for long.\nMaybe it's one off but here are the problems with mine:\n- works great when on wireless only yet the battery last for no time at all\n- when connected to charge via USB C (as well as wireless dongle connected) the keyboard is playing around constantly. It will start flashing lights like there is low battery and randomly some keys will stop responding, then after 30sec no keys respond at all until slide the switch to off and on again or unplug USB C which renders the keyboard useless.\n- sometimes whatever options you set in software gets ingored (for example if you watch the movie and you set your keyboard to volume up) when you turn the nob it will start spotify and play that instead of film. Restart Logitech software and it somehow works until next time you are trying to switch windows and it will randomly play music Full volume.\nSuch expensive keyboard - great design and feel very premium yet for me it's very dissapointing for company like Logitech which I'm forever fan as their tech just works - so not sure if this is random keyboard or others do have the same issue.\nReturned"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"In the last few weeks, I have had 3 keyboards. I was attempting to get a keyboard to improve my workflow.\nI hit gold with this item. It is just phenomenal\nIt early to determine the durability so my review at this point is based purely on aesthetics and my typing experience.\nI have never ever used a better keyboard.\nThe key travel, though low profile is exact to my taste as I have been biased in favour of Laptop keyboards.\nThis keyboard is not a gaming product. It is more tuned to productivity.\nAll I will say is, you will bear a pleasant smile when you purchase this product."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I bought this keyboard to use at home and be able to easily switch from my work Mac laptop to a Mac Mini which is my home computer. One keyboard and mouse, one set of screens, two computers. This keyboard seemed to be a perfect bridge for my setup.\nThere are of course other features such as the scroll wheel, build quality and how the keys feel, but the ability to easily switch was my primary reason for buying it.\nScroll Wheel\nThis is fun, but in reality, your muscle memory for doing the same thing with keyboard shortcuts means you sort of have to remember to use it and I found I forgot to use it.\nKey travel\nTyping was actually rather good, I am used to the shallower keys of the Apple keyboards, but this worked well I found. There are bumps for your fingers to fall into as you type and if I am honest I wasn't mad about this, I prefer flatter keys and when I timed myself I found that I was actually slower with this keyboard than when I used a Mac keyboard.\nBuild\nThe keyboard weighs quite a bit so it doesn't slip around on the desk which is nice. It feels really well made and like it would last well. The keys light up which is really nice and the motion sensor is a nice touch, but you need to turn that off if you want to use the keyboard wirelessly. You can of course have it constantly charging but that rather defeats the purpose. Plus you can't replace the batteries so I imagine constantly charging it would end the life of the device sooner than expected. D'Oh!\nBluetooth\nThis is where things really start to fall down. At set up I added my two computers and all was good. I even added my iPad pro for fun and that worked well too. But as the computers went to sleep the bluetooth connectivity would drop and then when it came to use one of the computers, I found the keyboard wasn't connected so I couldn't type in the password to unlock it meaning I had to get out the wired keyboard, type in the password, re-connect the Logitech keyboard and then start over, connect the device and type in a six digit code - EVERY TIME! Sometimes it would drop and then not see the device as I think the bluetooth device key is cached and the computer thinks it is already connected. So you go round in circles trying to get the thing working whilst not actually doing any work!\nThat game got dull very quickly so I tried to get in touch with Logitech support, who never replied (still haven't 5 weeks later). I spoke to Apple support (thinking this might be a software issue) who were great, but couldn't solve it for me. I even formatted my machine to exclude it being a corrupted bluetooth preference file or similar. I looked online for more info and eventually found a forum which was comprised of OSX and Windows people bemoaning this very issue and also Logitech support for being non existent.\nSo I sent the keyboard back (Amazon being great as ever) and ordered the Apple Magic keyboard which is very nice. It doesn't have the switch options, but I'm learning that no keyboard really can, at least not now.\nIf you are trying to solve the same thing as me, I am now using a KVM (Keyboard, Video Monitor) switch, software that Logitech were basically trying to use via their Options product, but synced to buttons on the keyboard. The product I am using is called Synergy. This does the job I was after. It's not perfect, but better than not working at all which is what you get with this Logitech keyboard."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Update Nov 26 2017: Problem solved, I simply switched to using the supplied Logitech Unify receiver dongly thing on the MacBook Pro. No connection issues and it connects faster too. This keyboard is outstanding and probably the best keyboard ever made. The dial becomes more useful once you build it into your work flow, although I use it mainly for Spotify - pressing it Plays or Pauses, twisting adjusts the volume etc.\nAm posting this hoping I'll get some help from fellow Mid 2015 15\" MacBook Pro users. First of all, I go through keyboards like crazy, never finding one I like, but this pretty much is I think 'the one', blending the all important typing experience with great back lighting and all round versatility. Am using it to 'drive' my Note8 (friends who think they can type quickly on their iPhones now have an adversary, mwah ha ha!), a Google Pixelbook and aforementioned MacBook. However, after my MacBook has been asleep for longer than a certain time (not sure how long it needs to be yet), when I wake it up with my corded mouse, the Craft refuses to connect, and I have to login using the Macbook keyboard. (I have it covered.) I am convinced this an Apple issue, not Logitech, else my other devices would not connect after being off or asleep. Once I login on the Macbook using it's own keyboard, most of the time, it re-connects, but sometimes I have to unpair and re-pair.\nAnyone else with a Mid 2015 MacBook Pro 15\" with latest version of Mac OS having this issue or am I 1 in 6 billion? :P\n5 stars when the problem is solved!"},{"rating":"2.0","content":"The Logitech Craft wireless keyboard feels pretty good to use, until you actually connect it to your computer.\nThe partner software, Logitech Options, is abysmal and lacks any basic features. Using the \"crown\" causes an obnoxious popup to appear on your screen telling you what you're using; there is no way to disable this. The Crown itself is pretty interesting, it has potential to increase workflow, however it is incredibly limited in what it can do, and most of its functionality is not customisable and only works in very specific programs, sometimes when you don't want it to.\nLogitech Options really is the bane of this product. It allows customisation of very, very few keys, and if you happen to use both an options enabled mouse and keyboard, your Fn button causes your mouse to become unresponsive while held even when the feature (whose name I forget) is disabled. I would recommend not installing it all if that were an option.\nAs far as membrane keyboards go, it's lovely to type on. The keys are bouncy and sturdy, and although I would have liked a teensy bit more feedback, I felt bad returning this product when it was such a nice typing experience. The entire keyboard is very, very sturdy and feels great to move around. Battery performance leaves a lot to be desired, however, as the thing will last anywhere between 20-10 hours once disconnected depending on usage and brightness. Not a problem for me personally, but if you're used to more basic keyboards you might also be used to them lasting several months on once charge.\nAt the end of the week, I had to return this. £140 was far too much to ask for a keyboard with so many flaws. I might be willing to pay £80 for a version without the silly crown, as this is a very satisfying keyboard to just use as a basic, featureless bluetooth keyboard around the office.\nUnfortunate that so many of its \"features\" actually wound up being detriments."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I bought this keyboard as I like the chiclet style and Logitech are a brand I have used for years so when I refurbed by home office I went for it. I also bought the MX-Ergo trackball but more on that later.\nMy initial thoughts are that it's well made and feels sturdy, it's nice and heavy. The backlight is nice but I don't use it.\nThe dial is a bit of a pain. It has a free running smooth turn mode and a click mode which is contextual. It changes from click to smooth depending on what application you have open and what the dial's function is. There is a small mechanism inside the keyboard that changes this mode and you can hear it clicking inside the keyboard.\nThere is a new logitech program called options which allows you to change the function of the dial for a generic mode and one for each application. I set them all to volume up/down and push for mute.\nThis has caused me a problem though, the dial still seems to randomly change from smooth to click mode and when it does that the volume jumps up and down by increments of 15 instead of increments of 1.\nI've logged a case with logi and they went through some troubleshooting but to no avail. Apparently they are replacing it as mechanical failure but that was over a week ago they said this and nothing has happened since then.\nAnother slightly annoying feature is that this keyboard is rechargeable and it uses USB-C to connect to a charger. That in itself is no problem. However,  I also bought the MX Ergo trackball when I bought this and that uses micro USB. It's a little thing but really irritating that I have to use two leads for two logi products that are from the same product line."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I have a Surface keyboard which I adore, but it's Bluetooth only.  I also use two computers over a KVM, so I couldn't use that keyboard.  I needed something that was close to that, but with a standard USB dongle.  This seems to be the best bet.  I don't mind paying for quality.\nThe keys are a cut above normal chiclet keys, but not as good as the Surface.  What is incredibly annoying is the dual PC / Macintosh key legends.  I thought I wouldn't mind.  I touch type, and though that it wouldn't matter.  It does.  Those visual clues you use to position your hands just disappear, the times you're going for an unusual character, it's a mess.  Do I want the ' character above the right hand shift key, or next to the left?  If I want ~ , I have a choice of two - one next to enter and the other next to left shift.  They standardise the keycaps to Macintosh to the left and PC to the right, but you don't want to think when you're typing - you want to just instantly react to a cue.  It's frustrating when you find the wrong one.  The keyboard fails abysmally at this.  It also looks appalling.  My surface keyboard is clean and uncluttered.  My understanding of Apple users is that they appreciate design as well.  I'd be surprised if an Apple fan were happy with this design.  The only acceptable use of this would be for somebody using it for two computers (as I am), but with one of each flavour.  Or of course, to cost cut your keyboard and reduce SKUs in inventory, which is, of course, the real reason.\nI'm out of my 30 days now, so some judicious permanent marker use and it's now more dedicated to PC.  It looks scruffy, but a lot less cluttered and confusing.\nThe dial is ok, but not a patch on the surface dial.  I use the logitech dial as a volume control and my surface dial for its well integrated functionality (and the neat on-screen stuff).  It's useful as a volume control, but it doesn't affect my productivity.  There's nothing it can do that can't be better done by another mouse wheel.\nIn summary, had I paid £70 for this, I'd have put up with the compromises, but at this price I shouldn't have to.  I'm continuing with it, but I'll be keeping my eye out for some sort of Bluetooth Rx -> USB Keyboard emulator so that I can go back to my Surface keyboard.\nBattery life is a week at best with dim infrequent backlight use.  I hate to do this comparison again, but my Surface keyboard lasts months (no backlight, though).  Major plus point for using USB Type-C, though.  I can't wait to bin my micro USB leads.  Why did it take so long to get reversible connectors?\nIf you use just Macs, or Just PCs, do yourself a favour and get the Apple or Microsoft keyboard.  If you're KVMing between both then this is perfect."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Ok it's expensive but it's also a very solid unit and I'm sure will stand the test of time.  The keys require more pressure than a standard keyboard but I personally like this.  I've been using the keyboard for several months now and can honestly say my hands/fingers have never felt fatigued as someone indicated in a recent review.  The dial is great for Adobe Photoshop editing but a bit overkill for other app's but still I nice and more precise way of controlling volume or tabs.  The illumination is great and there are no tell tale signs of any wear.  Battery life is very good.

Though the best keyboards, in terms of sheer typing performance, that I have used were made by IBM in days gone by, yet I like this product a lot because of the dependable wire-free (Bluetooth) connection, its features and a reliable software.\nI have used the keyboard for nigh on three weeks and haven't had any problem with dropped connections or the software included with it. In terms of typing performance, there is good key travel (though mechanical keyboards are the best), and key spacing is good, too. It doesn't have height adjustment function, which I miss sometimes.

I am sure some people will find it very useful\nOh and the battery life is not good at all\nI don't think that it is worth the money if it is only the keyboard that you will use the most.

It has a nice weight, good spacing for the keys and illumination is good.\nThe dial on the other hand is sort of OK. Is it suppose to be smooth or ratchet when used and you have no control over it. When used in applications I expected more."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Love the keyboards layout and feel. Bluetooth seems a bit crap though, it’s been set up working fine for a few days l, I brought it into work to try and use it and I’ve spent all day trying to get it to connect to multiple devices via Bluetooth. It’s nearly 2pm I’ve wasted a full days work. I bought this to speed up my creativity, this is very frustrating. For £150 I’d expect better."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Buy only if you need the 'wheel' for a specific function otherwise you will never use it. It is a heavy, steady keyboard with one of the nicest built qualities that I have ever seen, however,​ you could spend your money on a much cheaper one without losing much of the functionality."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Only received the EXPENSIVE keyboard today. But it is so nice to use. I already had an expensive K800 keyboard, this surpasses it. Fantastic quality, not sure I can justify the cost, but, I do so like it. If you want a keyboard like no other, and can afford it, I recommend it."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Expensive keyboard but it is top good quality. Typing experience is really nice and the dial button comes in handy. I use the keyboard for work, 8 hours a day and its still on the first charge after 3 weeks, battery level is still over half !..\nIf you dont mind spending the money its well worth it .."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"You’ll need a basic keyboard if you are building a computer to install osx/windows/linux etc. Once installed you’ll have the coolest keyboard on the block"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Extremely solid piece of kit and works well when running multiple OSs in a KVM scenario."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Quality build and a good price from Amazon, would suit a high end PC/Mac setup."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"this keyboard is the 'dogs'\nI love it (photographer - video editor)"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Takes a bit of getting use to and the battery life is not the best, but the backlit keys are worth the price."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Well designed and manufactured product which speeds up typing and communications with the PC and iPad.
