I needed a new pair of headphones as I’d left my previous pair in the hotel room in Cyprus. I never buy really expensive ones as I’m pretty rough whilst out and about djing so I like to cushion the blow of breaking them by buying cheap. These headphones go nice and loud and the sound remains clear and punchy whilst plugged into my mixer. I have to turn the volume up nowhere near as loud anymore to get the sound I want. They are light and kinda plasticy and feel like they could break if you were to be quite rough or accidentally twist them the wrong way but overall I’m quite happy with how they are. Managed to survive two weekends of djing so far so not yet to see the longevity of these."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"As an unpaid professional presenter (as our head of programming likes to call us) for a local hospital radio I have to say I was very impressed by the Behringer Hpx2000 headphones.\nThe day I ordered the Behringer I had just dropped and broken my previous headphones (HP1500 Pro from JBSYSTEMS) whilst broadcasting, having put them to one side on the desk they fell off and after almost 3 years one of the headphones started flopping about as the thin bit of plastic holding them in place had finally broken.\nDisappointed I started searching for a new set and stumbled accross the Behringer Hpx2000.\nAs a volunteer for the hospital radio, a full time dad and a part time employee I was looking for a set of budget headphones that felt comfortable, sounded good and weren`t too flimsy.\nWith the Behringer Hpx2000 I found all three requirements - after much adjustment I found a perfect position for the headphones at which point their comfort was apparent (before that I was thinking I wouldn`t want to wear them for long periods of time), the sound from the start was very good but took some adjustment on my home stereo to balance (which gave me pause) although when plugged into the desk at the studio the sound was great straight of the bat, and the build quality seems to be really good - they are very chunky and plastic but where the headphones join to the headband is very solid indeed, leading me to believe they are solid and won`t break easily.\nDon`t get me wrong, I`m no headphone expert (at least not in a technical sense), but I have been presenting for a long time now and know how I like my headphones to feel and sound, and the Behringer Hpx2000 headphones tick all the right boxes\nTrue the lead is possibly a little short unless you`re sat next to the input socket but then again if you want to listen to a home stereo from a distance I suggest investing in a cordless set of headphones.\nFor me personally the Behringer Hpx2000 do exactly what a set of headphones should do and I have no problem with the sound quality at all, in fact I`m even thinking of ordering a backup set just in case, although I may also try another budget set for comparison so I can be even more objective than just comparing them to my old HP1500 Pro`s.\nHope this helps!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Bought these because I liked their specification liked the freq. response and their sensitivity which gave me an idea of their dynamic range,but also the good looks. I had some amplified speakers from Behringer called B2031A TRUTH(studio monitors).Those I bought without hearing them just from the specs and the design philosophy  (active crossover and bi amplification,absolute flat response ,tweeter wave-guide) and features.I admit I read some controversial reviews about Behringer B2031A some horrible and some very good so it was a risk as it seemed they had serious quality control issues.But again I heart other professional speakers from Behringer  performing live and were stunning sounding so I went for them.\n Well, their truth made my expensive audio system sound obsolete so I bought those headphones with great expectations based on my previous experience above described, and specs.\nI knew they were affordable but it doesn't take a million to make good hifi if you know a thing or two(no matter how this is marketed).\nThe remaining left to cheer luck was if they were comfortable to wear. I didn't go wrong on that either. They are comfy and sound very good, very accurate with music. I had only a few hours of listening sessions with these and have  no issues with them."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Basically, my original intention for buying this product was because I read that they are slightly safer for hearing than the standard cheap headphones, and in my case, it has definitively proved to be, as I no longer get any kind of temporary deafness or ringing after listening to my music now. I feel much safer using these.\nSo onto the headphones themselves, great quality and can go straight into your computer, laptop, mp3 player etc. Adjustable fit for your head works well, and in general it is very comfortable.\nReally recommend this for those who regularly listen to music with headphones.\n 5/5."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Using for listening to audio on Laptop/Ipod and for play on electronic keyboard, guitar AMP etc. These Headphones are reasonably comfortable to wear, seem to be well constructed, look good and they meet my needs very well. Arrived on time, well packaged."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"These are a replacement pair of DJ headphones. I had a pair of these a few years ago. In my experience Behringer products are often a tad fragile - these included. If you don't abuse them, they perform OK. They come with a 1/4\" jack adaptor as most headphones do, the lead is a decent length. If you're harsh on your headphones then I'd skip these and pay more for a more rugged brand."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Headphones should weigh practically nothing. My last Behringer headphones did. These ones however could sink a ship.\nAnd the foam earcups are basically horrendous circular design, never intended for human ears which are OVALS, NOT PERFECT CIRCLES.\nI can't even get the original ones I had because Behringer has so kindly made their other pair for Amazon Prime users only.. I will be buying earphones instead from an entirely different place once the nightmare of these headphones and this customer treatment has passed.\nF'ing horrible. Avoid."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"I've owned several pairs of headphones at around this price range, so I think I can judge them fairly.\nThese are supposed to be over-ear headphones, but they're somewhere between over-ear and on-ear. I don't have large ears but still I felt like there was barely any space for them, with my ears pressed up against the hard part inside the cups. I have a small head but I felt like they were clamped the sides of my head rather than resting on the top of my head. My ears also never get hot with other headphones even when I have them on for a couple of hours, but these managed to become unbearable after just half an hour.\nAlso they leak sound and there's barely any bass - which means no immersion.\nI guess if you can stand the shape and don't care about the lack of bass and sound leakage then they might be worth the price."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"They are perfect, but I'm sending them back because I have thick ears, long ears. If you do too then go for Behringer HPS3000. These ones have great sound but they are too round on the ears and ears aren't round! They ached my ears after 2 minutes."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I think these are excellent value for the money and give a very good, clear sound. My daughters have them too and like them. I have tried more expensive phones but they did not sound better, so I'd buy them again if necessary."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"A nice good looking set of stereo audio headphones. These are great to use for any disc jockey around the world. They work great at a disco and drown out the music you can here in the background well. You do still have to listen through the phones though, you still know what is playing in these headphones."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Very pleased boyfriend, they arrived fast and very well protected. Sound is very good and clear."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"I'm so glad I didn't buy these with my own money (I used a voucher to purchase them as an extra pair to my sennheiser hd598 ones). The price reflects how cheaply made and awful these things are. So many problems I don't know where to begin:\nBehringer apparently don't acknowledge the existence of midrange frequencies. Everything on the top end is tinny and piercing whilst the bass booms in an almost-but-annoyingly-not-quite convincing imitation of mid to sub bass.\nI used them for a while (carefully, by the way: I treat all my musical gear with great care) and soon the cradle for one of the cans broke on one side. Annoying, but not detrimental as it was just repaired with gaffa tape. Soon after that, a loose connection somewhere stopped any sound coming from the left can. Determined to use these because they were so cheap, I cut out the section of wire that had gone wrong and spliced it together again. The same thing happened again after another week and, being so fed up by this time, I chucked them away.\nBe productive, work hard and earn some more dosh before buying headphones - don't be tempted by these as I was because of the price, you'll just be frustrated time and again."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Item as described. Thank you."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Hmmm... Well, they're OK. I bought them for some silent guitar practice, and all I can say is: they're OK. Very plasticky so not sure how long they'll last. Sound quality OK. Comfortable to wear - at first - with plenty of adjustment, but become uncomfortable after 30min or so. One thing that has annoyed me is the length of the lead - at 2m it's not very generous and I needed an extension cable. My verdict: Not excellent, but certainly OK for the price."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Beautiful design and outstanding quality! These headphones are perfect in everyway.

Not compared to more expensive headphones.  But all in all very pleased."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Verrey good set of head phones sound is crystal clear can't go rong for price just start mixing hardcore agen and they are great"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Works well with my decks"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I agree with everything said by rperkin.I paid these less than he  did.. .They are OK...I expected them to be in metal, I was disappointed it was plastic.....I bought them cuz i wanted something very good for gasming but i did not want spend too much...They looked so strong and i thought to try it.. The sound is fine, but the headphone itself is quite heavy after a while i wear them, they tend to to fall off my head, they are too big and uncomfortable..the cable is too short...Overall these headphones are ok but not great, i m happy with them for what i paid.."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I like the sound stage presented by these headphones. Frequency response is good. It's comfortable to wear.Good value."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"If you are starting out as a DJ and are looking for an affordable set of headphones, then these are definitely it! It is comfortable, the sound quality is excellent and it looks and feels great!. The only thing I have against it (and I am nit-picking) is that it is quite big and prominent when you put it on. But don't really care about that much - this is my second one!"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"perfect, just not much base"},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Audio jack snapped off into my DJ controller about six months after purchase.
