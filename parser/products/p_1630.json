I spent a weekend on the phone to some very helpful people in the Phillippines on the Microsoft helpline.  Eventually it was up to speed and up to date.  Now only three months on, there is no sound on it at all.  Programmes close down without warning; online stuff won't load - although there's no problem with other devices in the home."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"I liked the small size of this laptop and its rugged design that was nonetheless quite elegant.\nOut of the box however I had multiple problems with Windows 10 which appear to be traceable to the graphics card which caused frequent crashes, not least on the first bootup.\nSubsequent Windows updates (of which there were several!) were all characterised by multiple errors and crashing. Several hours spent on the phone to Windows support. Who assisted with installing newer versions of Windows which sadly did not prevent the machine from crashing further.\nVideos were unwatchable as freezing/crashing would occur within minutes, ditto photo viewing and editing, hence deducing the graphics card was at fault, only remedied by rolling back the driver, which diminished viewing quality.\nSadly, had to return this nifty machine."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"This laptop is exceptionally affordable (£159) and laptops with this amount of storage (64gb) with these specs tend to cost a lot more. The laptop appears to be well built, the keyboard is good for typing with generous key travel and the touchpad is of a reasonable size. The screen is bright. I am impressed with the fact that this laptop also has a rugged and spill proof design which makes this price point even more surprising. The charger is small and does not have a brick. The blue and grey colour scheme looks alright. Performance wise, this is ok for web browsing but updates will take a while and installing them will make the laptop slow. After reading some other reviews about ASUS laptops such as the c202 I was a bit sceptical about buying this. I saw that the warranty didn't cover fallen keys for the c202. This tempted me to get amazon protect but it won't cover breakdowns in the first year. However, since it is so cheap and has no excess I see it to be a great deal. The laptop worked well for me until I was let down by a few problems here and there. The touchpad stutters occasionally and interprets drags as taps. Videos froze a couple of times. The system crashed at least 6 times and I have had to force shutdown the laptop. The speakers click before and after playing audio. If I didn't have these problems this would be a 5 star review. I suspect that there may be a hardware or software problem with this laptop. I can see that another reviewer has had similar problems but I don't know if this affects all laptops of this specification. I tried factory resetting the laptop and installing drivers but I am still getting some of these problems. The battery wouldn't charge past 30% for 2 days. It is unfortunate that a laptop at such a competitive price with good features has been let down by these issues. This might be an exception and I may be able to get a flawless budget laptop if I order another one of these, however there doesn't seem to be much  else I can do about the laptop I have with me apart from a return."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"I've had the laptop for less than a week and had to reset the PC three times ( once with Amazon Technical support Theo ).\nThe help option does not work due to a technical malfunction and you can't access the online manual when the laptop needs to be reset.  I wish I could just send it back but Theo tells me I have to explore other options first. My worst purchase on Amazon."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Now this is a nice little notebook I am an adult. I like the anti glare screen. I was frustrated with the windows 10s so upgraded to the window10 Pro ind it upgraded perfectly so I’m happy with it.

I would recommend it for kids and adults."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I hope its all good :) Looks good and seems to work well! Good for home use or for office work! Great for school work!

I upgraded to windows 10 pro easily and the battery life is amazing !!! 11 hours is accurate !

BTW I live in France and the parcel was delivered on-time ( a day early actually)."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I bought two of these for my 10 year old children.  First impressions are good, set up was easy ish (I'm not a fan of windows 10).  One unit experienced the Blue Screen of Death but worked fine after an operating system reinstall (easy process).\nThey seem fast enough for what I need them for although I would not recommend this product as a main computer.  Web browsing, YouTube and Netflix plus some word processing is about the limit but that's fine with me as this is what I need them to do.\nMy only concern is the power socket seems a bit woolley, the children will need to be careful when charging this product."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great rugged laptop I used the option to upgrade to Windows 10 Professional. It's not a powerhouse but if you commute and want a laptop to throw in your bag and get the job done then you can't go far wrong. I was a little dubious about storage 64GB but I still have about 18GB free and I have the option to store things via Google Drive to share files across devices if needed."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Purchased this wanting a silent laptop, smaller than most with the intention of writing as such I wanted it to be capable of Word Processing, light internet browsing at reasonable speeds and it does just that with a decent battery life as well.\nAll in all great for the price, does just what I want just make sure you understand it's limitations thought in my case this is perfect because having a more capable PC I find it too easily to become distracted and procrastinate."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I wanted a laptop to take away when travelling. I read all the reviews on this laptop and decided to buy. I'm very glad I did. It's a nice looking laptop. It feels very robust and has rubbery edges. It's very lightweight. I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro straight away, loaded my antivirus and then loaded Affinity Photo, everything is working great. The screen is absolutely fine, I'm just designing a website, no probs. I thought the hotkeys didn't work to start with but discovered that on Asus laptops you have to hold down the fn key at the same time. Windows did a monster download, which took 4 hours, I thought it had frozen up and was panicking but it was fine and it eventually finished. The fact that it doesn't have tons of memory concerned me a bit so I've bought a portable SSD drive so that has overcome that problem."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Excellent notebook. upgraded to Windows Pro with np's.\n4gb ram & 64gb hdd makes a big difference to everyday use.\nthe battery life is the best I've had on any laptop/tablets, if u use it for Internet & the odd program ie word etc. it will give u 2days use. about 11hrs from a full battery charge."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"Upgraded to Windows 10 Pro for free as soon as I got the laptop, installed Thunderbird email client and OpenOffice as well as couple other applications on it.

After adding 10 pro and office and the updates, I have approx 10gb remaining. I got a 128gb sd card to up the storage, so that sorts that out. It took a while to do the initial updates, but they loaded no problem and loading office was effortless too. It is sturdy, but still looks nice.
