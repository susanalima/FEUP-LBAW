I REALLY didn't want a wireless keyboard. However, I just HAD to have a play/pause button and a calculator button and it was so hard to find a wired keyboard that wasn't the same as my previous one. I eventually bit the bullet and got this one.\nThe design is nice and I was quite impressed at first. Of course it had the play/pause button and the calculator button just as I wanted. What could go wrong? Well. I'm typing on it right now and it is SO NOISY. Seriously, the loud clacking is driving me nuts. Secondly, when I run some programs the keyboard just gives up, I can't use it or type without incredible lag (sometimes it just doesn't type at all). This sucks because I regularly use keyboard shortcuts on everything... So yeah it looks good and all but it's not too functional for me. And if you hate loud typing then definitely do NOT get this."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I bought this to replace the now-defunct K200, which is the wired (not wireless) version of this keyboard.  I thought I had managed to kill mine with a full mug of tea (happily, after 2 days and a final, probably 6th attempt at putting it back together after cleaning it, the K200 is working again).  There's a slight difference in the key action, but this K270 has the same dimensions and layout as the K200 that has survived 2 years hard labour in my service, so it has a familiar feel, which is why I went for it.\nIt's a fairly quiet (though not silent) keyboard, with enough action for those who have years of experience with the clunking clicketty-clack feel of early keyboards, though with much less height of keystrokes needed, so less tiring.\nAll the usual keys are there (the Euro shares the 4 / $ key, just press Alt Gr for  instead of Shift for $), plus a row of media keys (play/pause, mute, Vol up & down, browser homepage, email, PC sleep and calculator ... although I only ever use the calculator button).\nIt's compact for a full keyboard, so great if you are short on space, but don't want to lose the numbers keypad etc on a smaller keyboard.\nMy biggest gripe is merely one of aesthetics - why put the ugly PC-beige base with the matt black upper?"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I purchased this keyboard to replace a Microsoft wireless 2.4GHz keyboard which always picked up USB 3 interference.  The Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse works well around USB 3 devices (a known interference issue). However, the Logitech keys are a big mushy and wiggly to the touch.  There is this ever so slight perception that the key caps roll slight while they are being pressed. They also lack a positive action to the touch, so I find that even though I pressed a key, it does not register. The feel of the keyboard is important to me (the Microsoft one has more positive tactile feedback).  If you like decent tactile feedback, then this probably isn't the keyboard for you. But its functional and works for occasional use."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I purchased the Logitech K360 ( http://amzn.eu/fwugjeQ ) - and threw away the packagin straight away. What a mistake. I knew I was not going to get on with it because the keys just were cheap and plastic feeling when I pressed them.\nSo within less than one day of working with it I have gone and bought this model. The K360 will get to work with the rarely used RPi\nThis is agreat budget keyboard but how I wish I had my k520 back - it was definitely a much better quality keyboard. Until I tried to clean it and broke the space bar.\nOnly reason I am not giving 5 stars is that I am used to the K520 which had much nicer feeling keys but it is definitely better than the more expensive K360."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I'm really pleased with this.\nMy previous KB was a Microsoft usb wired unit -one of the \"comfort curve\" things. It was ok, but like most wired units I use/abuse it developed a wiring fault in the connecting cable. Whilst throwing stuff away offends my sensibilities, green-binning it seemed the only practical course as there didn't seem to be any simple way of replacing the cable.\nI decided to get the Logitech 270.  The long battery life plus on-off switch appealed as did the ~£20 price for something from a reputable manufacturer.\nI had a Logitech wireless mouse already -which has proven excellent - and as the keyboard could share the same receiver this  was attractive too(so, I now have a spare receiver!).  Things worked pretty much  straight out of the box, there was nothing to install (in win10).\nThere are some special function keys which are all pretty obvious as to their purpose -sound on/off/volume and so on. Just be careful with the one that's labelled PC (with the power symbol).  This shuts your PC down -fairly obviously(?).  Perhaps it's something specific to my rig but it's not a graceful shutdown, it seems to be instant - which suggests it could cause some damage to your Windows installation.  However, as I tend not to use these special keys anyway - I tend to forget they are there - its not a problem for me.\nOverall, for £20, this is seems a really good buy."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I've been using a Logitech keyboard for a lot of years so when I committed to a biiiig PC upgrade in Dec 2013 I didn't even bother sourcing a keyboard from another manufacturer (alright I did check out a couple of Microsoft keyboards, but still...)\nMy needs for a keyboard were pretty much next to nil; I really was chasing something basic: I wanted a black, normal sized keyboard (not one of those mini-boards that seem to be popular at the moment or any of those nut-job massive gamer keyboards), preferably absent of lots of superfluous feature-buttons and preferably (though hardly compulsory) a wireless capability .\nThe K270 has proved itself to be perfect for me. The keystrokes aren't too intrusive (as in they're nice and quiet) and the fact that it's wireless turned what was for a me a nice-have option into a must-have feature should I be requiring a new keyboard in the future.\nA minor disappointment regarding the wireless feature is it's range. This keyboard and my PC-tower are all of about a metre apart and yet the keyboard would miss keystrokes and its responsiveness was intermittent; my solution was to insert the dongle into a USB extension cable and drop that behind my monitor; it's behaved flawlessly ever since.\nAnd about that dongle: It's a small unassuming little USB gadget that apparently supports several like-minded Logitech devices; my Logitech M705 mouse has one of these as well so I thought that it would have been able to send to the keyboard's dongle but... it doesn't. That really is picking nits though as I said, this keyboard is perfect for me."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I have a netbook which I usually use at a desk by attaching it to a monitor and peripherals to be able to use it as a desktop PC. I previously used a wired keyboard which was a bit of a hassle because it meant yet another wire. So I decided to purchase this wireless keyboard on January 2014 and after more than 2 years (Feb 2016) of extensive use, I believe I have earned the right to write a review for this keyboard.\nPrice, Delivery & Packaging:\n- I paid £17.42 in January 2014.\n- From what I can recall the delivery was prompt and the keyboard was safely packaged.\nConstruction:\n- The keyboard is made of plastic and has been made in China.\n- It does feel a bit cheap but the quality still seems fine and is good enough to have lasted me over 2 years.\n- Approx. dimensions are (L x W x H): 44 x 15 x 2.5 cm\n- There are 2 plastic legs on the bottom, which when extended, help raise the level of the keyboard.\n- The keys aren't exactly quiet but are still quieter than other keyboards I have used. The sound created by depressing the keys can be defined as a somewhat muted sound - can be heard but not as loud.\nFeatures:\n- There is an on/off button to switch off the device when going away for an extended period of time e.g. on vacation. I have scarcely used the on/off button - perhaps only on a couple of occasions before going on vacation and yet have forgotten to use it before leaving for most vacations.\n- The Keyboard automatically goes on standby after a set period of time. I have never bothered using the on/off button for normal everyday without any significant impact to the battery life.\n- There is no lag at all whenever use of the keyboard is resumed (e.g. at the beginning of the day). This is contrary to my experience of using wireless mouses which need a click to bring them back from standby mode.\n- It comes with a tiny wireless receiver that plugs into any USB slot of the PC (see pics). Mine permanently remains plugged into the USB slot and I have rarely felt the need to remove it. There is a neat little compartment on the bottom of the keyboard into which the wireless receiver can be stored whilst travelling or storing the keyboard (see pics).\n- The keyboard is meant to be spill proof, and comes equipped with 4 outlets on the bottom, although I've never been in a position to be able to test this feature.\n- Operates on 2x AAA batteries\n- It has a good selection of hot keys as follows:\n1) Play/Pause button\n2) Volume mute\n3) Volume low\n4) Volume high\n5) Home\n6) Email\n7) PC on/off button\n8) Calculator\nPracticality:\n- The keyboard is plug-n-play and should function fine with most PCs. I use a Windows Operating System and was on my way almost as soon as the keyboard was attached.\n- It is extremely convenient as it saves me from fumbling around with yet another wire.\n- It has great battery consumption. I have not yet had to replace the original set of batteries that were installed upon purchase (which was more than 2 years ago!).\n- Good standard size with UK layout\n- No issues with the signals at all. We have even used the keyboard in the lounge whilst connecting the netbook with the TV whilst streaming media and it has worked fine at a distance of about 3 meters.\n- On a slightly negative note, although the keyboard does have a 'Caps Lock' light that illuminates when it is on (see pics), it lacks similar lights for both the 'Num Lock' and the 'Scroll Lock' buttons which is pretty common on most other keyboards. Not a big issue but if there was any negative point to this keyboard then this would be it.\nConclusion:\nIt's a great piece of kit that has already exceeded my expectations, and has survived the odd abuse by my toddler. I use the keyboard on pretty much a daily basis and all keys are still intact and function perfectly. The size is what I would call a bit compact as there isn't much of a border around the keyboard, but is still the standard size. The size is just about right and is comfortable to use over an extended period of time.\nIn short, this is a great little piece of kit to use with your PC/netbook/laptop. It comes with a great price and has already lasted me over 2 years and still seems to be going strong. I would not hesitate to buy this again if/when my current keyboard finally does give way. It is by no means a specialist keyboard but I would definitely recommend this keyboard to anyone who is looking to purchase a simple keyboard with modest features without breaking the bank."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I bought this as my Logitec K750 (the solar powered one) was refusing to charge up, and I could not not currently justify spending so much to buy another of the same type. First off, I tried a MS one, which while nice while working kept loosing key presses after going into sleep mode; apparently it wasn't really compatible with Win 8.1! That was sent back.\nThis looked like a decent and cheap alternative.\nHaving been used to the K750, the K270 seems pretty clunky and (obviously, given the cost) less refined. The main problem, as others have said, is the play in the bottom of the keyboard near the space bar, which noticeably flexes and hits the desk while typing. Using the legs to raise back of the KB, or placing some cloth under the front of it seem to partially fix the problem; but neither are really satisfactory solutions. I also tried fixing a small (1mm) bit of rubber to the front middle support; that cured the problem, but introduced another. Namely that the same issue was then apparent at the TOP of the KB, making an even more annoying noise when typing most keys.\nThe keys themselves also seem rather loose and noisy, although they do seem responsive. It may well be that it's simply that I'm so used to the more laptop-like action of the K750 that after a while I'll get used to it.\nOverall, I'd still recommend this KB for the price; it's a very responsive wireless KB at low cost. And from several previous Logitec KBs, I know battery life won't be a problem."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great keyboard. Keys have a nice feel and I am able to touch type very fast without error. On my previous keyboard I kept pressing the CAPS LOCK accidentally. All the keys respond well - on my previous keyboard I sometimes had to hit a key extra hard or make sure I hit it in the centre to register.\nCAPS LOCK light is very useful - would have been nice to have a NUM LOCK light but I expect that would have an effect on the battery life.\nThe keyboard does have a small amount of bounce in the centre when supported on it's legs. It doesn't bother me and if it did I would put a blob of blu tak or similar in the centre to support it. Apart from that I can't fault it. I see some keyboards that are over twice the price as this one and I can't think what extra they could be giving you. At £21 this is great value for money."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"This is my first wireless keyboard and I am loving it.\nI can bring my monitor near bed or anywhere I want and still can type in any positions, that's so handy.\nThe keyboard quality feel very good, you got all key you need, battery lasts more than a year.\nOnly thing I don't like is the noise. Someone probably prefer this but for me it is bit too much. My flatmate said she can hear I'm typing from her room! I'll buy thinner but quieter keyboard next time."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I bought a Logitech Wireless Touchpad several months ago and having been very impressed by it decided to add to the range with the keyboard to give myself some added freedom. I am a Ubuntu user and Logitech is one of those brands that include Tux on their packaging and the keyboard will work out of the box.\nHowever if you want to use just one \"unifying receiver\" for more than one product (i.e. the touchpad and keyboard in my case as a single receiver can support 6 devices) then you will need access to a Windows or Mac computer to do the pairing. The software is s small download from Logitech and the process takes only a minute, but there is no Linux option so keep that in mind.\nOther than that I am really enjoying the keyboard, made to Logitech's usual high standard (I still use a trackball mouse from them bought in 1999) and the added bit of freedom and reduced clutter on the desk is superb. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought this unit as I wanted the ability to remove my keyboard from my small work-area when the space it occupied was required for other things.  I also did not want to pay an insane amount of money for that convenience.  The fact it was slated to work with my existing wireless Logitech trackball receiver was the icing on the cake.  In practice I have found it to perform excellently and never yet experienced any signal problems or loss of connection to my PC.  The key-action is precise enough, if a little light - although it goes without saying given the price-point that this feature was never going to hold a candle to Cherry's many offerings.\nSimply put - the K270 does everything that can be expected of a roughly £20 keyboard.  I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I bought this as I was fed up with using my laptop keyboard.  This keyboard plugged straight in using the packaged Unifying Receiver.  The keys are well space with nice chamfered edges, its difficult therefore to mistakenly press two keys by accident.  Good placement of the on/off switch and useful caps lock light.  Keys are bit rattly especially on mine, the space bar almost sounds loose.  I already had a Logitech wireless mouse with the unifying symbol on but a standard mini receiver.  I just couldn't get it to work, all the Googled fixes didn't work until I logged into the Logitech website for contact details and tried the download, ten seconds later all done and now keyboard and mouse work in happy harmony.  Yes I would purchase this keyboard again but glad there is a guarantee because I don't fully trust the spacebar."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Having had an expensive Logitech wireless illuminated keyboard before, brilliant quality, but needing something cheaper (e.g. no illumination), I was disappointed by the very clunky keyboard, not nice and soft/positive as my other model. There’s no need for the clunky key travel, it costs nothing to make it a quality feel.\nWould I buy it again - certainly not."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Having had wired keyboards for ages I really wanted to go wireless to tidy up my desk. It arrived on time and well packaged. It paired very quickly and hasn't lost connection once (been using a month now almost every day) It's quite noisy to type and in an office I imagine this would annoy the hell out of my colleagues but seeing as I use it at home it doesn't bother me at all. I really like this keyboard!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I replaced my wired keyboard so that I could use a Logitech unifying receiver to connect both a keyboard and my Logitech wireless mouse. It's handy because I frequently swap my personal laptop with my work laptop on my desk at home and just want to move one USB device from one computer to another.\nThe keyboard has a full-size key layout, but the case is quite compact which I like because it leaves more room free on my desk. The previous wired keyboard I was using was a bit of a monster.\nThe key feel is nice for me, but that's quite a personal taste. Haven't been able to gauge the battery life yet so can't comment on that. The wireless range is fine. In fact I've managed to pick up the keyboard upstairs in my house forgetting that my receiver was still plugged into my laptop downstairs and have found that I've accidentally typed a load of letters into my laptop."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Really glad with my purchase. The keyboard is exactly what I wanted. It is not super awesome in terms of its features and I guess gamers are not gonna love it. But for anyone who wants a wireless keyboard that is light, thin, durable, takes as little space as possible and its battery lasts for eternity, this is the keyboard to choose. I only gave it 4star rating because it doesn't have a caps lock indicator light and does not go well with Logitech's SetPoint software - under heavy computer load SetPoint, that usually controls higher quality logitech products that support customizations, gets in the way of the keyboard's proper function and sometimes delays keypresses. It's not a big deal, but gamers won't like it."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"The key board on my laptop started to shed keys. I bought another laptop keyboard but although it was the correct item it did not fit well. So rather than mess about  I looked around amazon and spotted this Logitec at a reasonable price that would just hook up to my laptop by wireless.\nIt arrived, unpacked, pulled the tab out to start the battery and put the wireless receiver into a USB  slot, watched it load itself for a few moments and it was in action.. So setting up was almost a nothing action, now using it to type the text you are reading. I use my laptop mainly at home, and a Tablet when travelling. So in a sense a perfectly good operational keyboard, at a reasonable price from a good manufacturer. I already use a wireless mouse so away we go."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I've bought three of these (for different computers!) and the only complaint I could name is that they tend to accumulate gunk.\nBattery wise they last for a very long time, and they are satisfyingly solid to type on.  Best thing for me is that they can use the same tiny dongle that the Logitech M series mice use so you only need one port on the PC."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Just received my keyboard and plugged in and up and running in seconds.  What a lovely keyboard it is.  As having been a professional touch typist for over 50 years, this is by far the nicest one I've ever worked on.  The keys are well spaced, so no inadvertent 'foreign' languages when you look up to the screen! (i.e. gkkrpgkgflnt ld,rgn) :-)  Lovely springy keys, and - so quiet.  Nice soft touch keys.  Sturdy, and looks nice.  I love the on-board keys for volume control, e-mail, internet etc, and even a calculator!  That sold me!!  Rubber feet are an added bonus, so no sliding around the desk.  All in all, this is the best value for money I have seen, and it is a fast keyboard, (trust me, you can work on keyboards, that DO slow you down).  I love it.  Well done Logitech, another winner.  Also the Unifying nano receiver will come in handy when it's time to replace my wireless mouse (Logitech of course).  If you're reading this wondering what wireless keyboard to buy, you can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"The keyboard is functional and works straight out the box with no problems; however, it feels cheap and has a lot of flex, and the spacebar makes a rattle every I press a key.\nI bought this to replace a broken Microsoft keyboard, with the intention of both writing university reports and playing FPS games. I find that the keys are a little smaller than I'm used to and this makes playing games difficult, but I think this is purely due to my being used to another keyboard and I expect it will get easier.\nThe function buttons work well and the keyboard power button is a nice touch, although I've seem some keyboards which turn off themselves.\nIn summary, I'd recommend this keyboard for light use, but as a heavy PC user I wish I'd gone a bit more up-market and gone for something a little more robust."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"A noisy ('clackety') keyboard with no caps lock indicator.

Great buy!\nUPDATE 28 July 2014\nI no longer use this keyboard. I keep losing signal on this keyboard and my mouse. Its not an issue of batteries because I check this regularly, but I just can't use it any more. It does not track my movements or my typing in the way I want it to.

It is very small, light, but in the same time it is a full size keyboard.\nPros:\n- size (good if have limited space or you want to bring it with in bed occasionally)\n- typing experience\n- the extra keys on the top (especially the ones for adjusting the sound volume)\n- price point (under 20 quid)\n- unifying receiver (I paired it with a Logitech M505 mouse which I bought a year ago)\n- typing sounds (it is not silent, because I prefer to hear a sound whenever I press a key - other might think differently)\nCons:\n-I haven't found one yet, but I'll update the review once I do"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Full size with separate number pad. I particularly like the \"Caps on \" light, which is not on most keyboards\nThe only downside is that the letters on the face of the keys has a tendency to wear off"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I have an old laptop set up as a home media center and I needed a way of controlling it from the sofa. This product meets my needs perfectly. There are two particular features that I appreciate in particular:\n1. The on/off switch. The option to turn the keyboard off when not in use rather than rely on some built-in standby mode is good for conserving battery power - very handy for a keyboard that is only rarely in use.\n2. Interference-free wireless. Probably this is only a problem for early wireless peripherals like the ones I was using before, but I consider it worthwhile to note that the USB receiver for the keyboard is plugged in next to a second receiver that supports a wireless mouse and both devices work perfectly."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Purchased this for using with my LG 3D SMART TV (LG55LM860V) based on other feedback that it worked with these TV's out of the box.\nI'm delighted with the quality of the keyboard and it DID the job with my TV immediately. Just plugged the mini receiver unit supplied into the TV's USB slot and switched on the keyboard. Hey presto! - I'm away typing merrily directly into the TV's website fields with no time lag. And so much easier than using the Magic remote for the TV!\nOnly slight issue is that one or two keys are wrongly configured - so ahve to use the SHIFT & 2 key to produce a \"@\" character. When I phoned Logitech support, they confirmed the keyboard cannot be re-configured and it is not a keyboard fault. They said it was not designed to work with a SMART TV but understood that many people were happily using it for this.\nSo apart from the need to remember a few different key strokes, it's a great partner for any SMART TV."}],"pictures":"\ndata:image/jpeg;base64,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
