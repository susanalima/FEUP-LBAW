I use a Google Pixel Tablet so decided on a Chromebook. This is so easy, from installing a USB printer to adding Apps. Battery lasts all day, and the  whole look is quality, full aluminium case, and anti glare screen it so good.. Startup in seconds rather than 20 minutes (Windows)"},{"rating":"1.0","content":"amazin tech support have just confirmed to me that no chromebook, especially the acer chromebook 14, has enough power to the usb ports to charge anything.\nafter 2 days of setting it up, learning how to use it I noticed my phone was dead, and it had been plugged into the chromebook the whole time, I had fully charged the chromebook before using for the first time, and it has been plugged in the entire time since. I tried al sorts of things, even tried different cables and a speaker, all charge on the laptop and none charge on the chromebook. Tech support confirmed there is a tiny amount of power to the usb ports, just enough to allow you to plug something in to transfer files, but no wehre near enough power to charge anything, ever. That i should send it back and buy somethign else.\nNo info on this on the acer site, no info on this on the amazon site - so I am writing this to warn you, don't waste your time like I had to.\nAlso - it dows not work with Sonos speakers at all - the \"android\" on a chromebook is apparently a weak cousin of android and is not compatible with many products that work fine on android, and finally - there is no CD drive - fine it says that on the product specs, you might think that is ok I iwll buy an external one, as I did, but even if you did, you cannot play DVD's, the weak chromse OS on chromebooks does not allow and has no plans to ever allow people to watch dvd;s, I suppose google want you to buy their downloads of films, but that is another reason why any chromebook is such a bad idea for anyone with dvd's, a phone, and any periferals like speakers that they can happily connect to with their pphone, because a chromebook cannot even do what a phone can!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"For £249 this does everything I need it to and does it brilliantly. A lot of bang for your buck.\nIf you want a cheap laptop for browsing, email, basic word processing etc then this might be for you. We were tied to Microsoft for ages due to needing to run a particular type of driver that only works with Windows, I'm happy with the move to Chromebook. I use an android phone and if you do too, then you'll get on with this.\nDownside is that it's a bit limited when without WiFi, and storage ain't great, and if you have an i device then you won't be able to use it with this (as far as I know).\nThe brilliant thing was the process for getting it set up is as follows:\n- Plug it in.\n- Turn it on.\n- Log in with your Gmail account\nThat's it. All your bookmarks, email drive and everything Googly is ready to use and it takes less than a minute.\nI believe (though not tried it) that you are still able to use Microsoft Office (if you have to) as long as you're happy using it in the browser.\nThere are more and more apps on the Play Store for this, including Spotify and Netflix.\nLoads up in seconds and the battery lasts all day of working."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I have been pleasantly surprised with my Acer Chromebook, quality kit at a very reasonable price. Excellent matt screen, good speakers, excellent battery life. Despite some reviews saying it isn't compatible with Microsoft Office I'm up and running with Word, Powerpoint and Excel. Setting up my wireless printer was simple too. The OS has taken a while to get the hang of, but youtube is awash with guidance.\nI'd have liked an sd slot, but that's a minor gripe.\nHighly recommended."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great tool for surfing the net etc easily links to TVs and the main home pc  would definitely recommend battery lasts for hours."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Arrived in super quick time and was super quick to set up.  Lovely keyboard , none of this typing and nothing happens.  I am so thrilled with this, and all the functions of a full size Laptop.  I travel so this is ideal.  Cannot praise this highly enough"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought this laptop for use at uni since my gaming laptop has poor battery life and is too heavy and big for my bag.\nThis Chromebook is light, easy to use and easy to set up - I logged into my Google account and everything was there. OneDrive is also very useful, as I can work on both my laptops and the document will appear on both without having to use a memory stick or DropBox. It’s very fast to start up and the screen quality is fantastic. I haven’t worried about battery life since I started using it and go to uni without always having to bring the charger with me.\nVery nice colour - I’d say it looks more like rose gold than gold, but that’s even better for me."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Brilliant bit of kit for the money.\nFeels very premium. Full working day from the battery.\nMy daughter is using it for secondary school studying and it does everything she needs it to do whilst feeling more expensive than it is.\nRuns Google Play store."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Delighted with this Chrome book, it's my third and best,\nI am 84 years old and I use it for many things including :-\nBanking, news, gmail, utube videos, word processing, I could go on and on.\nIt is fairly light and portable and very attractvely styled in a champagne gold metallic finish.\nThe chassis is aluminium making it strong and durable and the keyboard is excellent.\nI find it works best with a wireless mouse, the one I love is the Microsoft wireless mouse.\nAt present prices this laptop is surely a bargain.\nBrian."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Unfortunately, Chromebook's are still in the POS category for me. The Wi-Fi keeps dropping for no reason. If you have ten windows open, it becomes slow and laggy. Google Drive is still crap to navigate and use and as much as i hate to admit it, you still miss Word and Excel....they're still too useful. I'll be going back to a cheaper PC. As much as i'd like us to be, we're still not in a post Microsoft environment."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"All I can say is absolutely brilliant, I ditched my Windows 10 laptop for this chromebook, I wish I had done it sooner, chromebooks are so awesome."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great for basic tasks like browsing: starts quickly, light weight, good battery life."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"A good laptop/chromebook for daily use. U can do everything with it soon also MS OFFICE...GREAT!!!!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is my first Chromebook, but it definitely won't be my last.  I've always had Windows laptops in the past, and as other reviewers have said I got sick of the slow startup, the constant updates and how heavy they were for reasonably priced ones.\nThis Chromebook is the opposite of a windows laptop.  It starts instantly (1 or 2 secs), the battery seems to last a long time and its really light and easy to carry around and use.  I got the one with lesser storage (32GB), but then with cloud based options, I don't really see the need to store much locally anymore.\nThe keyboard and trackpad are good, the ports all seem to work fine and the power lead is not too heavy compared to some I've used in the past.\nI got this in the Black Friday sale for ~£180, and at that price its a bargain.  If what you want do is go online, watch stuff on Youtube etc, the chromebooks are for you.  It feels a bit like an Apple Macbook to use, but for about 15% of the price!"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Beautiful chromebook, great spec. However, there was a fault with the charging port on the one I got, so I returned it and brought the C302, which has a different one. Also no SD slot to upgrade memory. Other than that, couldn’t really fault it."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Excellent connectivity, amazing build, the battery life is around 7 hours on streaming."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I thought I had made a mistake when I had made my first purchase only to be told that it was not a computer and it could not do what a computer can do.  This might be true BUT the reality is that so far it has been able to do practically everything I have wanted to do and I love it.  So when my partner's computer bit the dust I recommended a Chromebook which was half the price of a replacement laptop.  She absolutely loves it and prefers it to her laptop even though the laptop supposedly had a much larger screen.  In reality the screen on the Chromebook is of such excellent quality it is easier to read."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Dear parents, if there’s one thing to say about this, then it’s this:  No more home IT support!!\nI had reservations about buying this, but my daughter assured me it was going to be perfect for her school work. When it arrived, I was really impressed with both the build quality and ease of set up. And, most of all, since having received it, I’ve not been plagued with any teenage complaints about it not working or being ‘crap’! She loves it and is even getting school work done on it.\nNow, if only I could find a wireless printer that was so well behaved...!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I was a bit sceptical buying this at first, having little experience of Acer devices. But an open box version was £185 at Amazon on Black Friday, so I took a chance and I am glad I did.\nThis is an absolutely brilliant Computer. It's light, portable, fast and well built. The battery actually lasts the whole day under normal use. Keyboard feels nice and comfy to type on, this is all what I need and I have sold my old windows laptop in favour of this.\nThe only few negatives I could point out are: The bezel around screen is a bit too thick for my liking, and the touchpad is not very top quality and takes a bit of effort to click. But I forgive Acer considering it's a sub £200 laptop, that performs brilliantly."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I like the chromebook its very easy to use for the internet. If you want to do anything other than that get something else."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Best buy ever! Really light, fast and perfect to carry around everywhere - only wish I could download programs as this would make it perfect, but that is not what it is for - I can save in the cloud anyway - highly recommend if you don't need any apps and mostly use internet or dial into servers!

Not good for professional use but good for kids or recreational use. Microsoft programs and other pc programs won't run ot the laptop.

I originally bought mine Sept. 2017, and I've done nothing but take great care of it, never dropped it, always had it in a protective case, never left it running for extended periods of time. One day it just decided to stop working, with the graphics card being trashed. I expected it to last longer than at least a year before I had to fork out more money just to keep it alive, and so If I were you I would find a better laptop, or expect to hand over money for an extended warranty."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Got this for my son who's just started secondary school.
