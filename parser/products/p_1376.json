The screen is sharp and relatively bright, once the colour was adjusted slightly. Some dvds look slightly washed out but this is likely due to the fact that they are 8 to 10 years old and this is a 1080p screen. Streaming movies and shows from prime and Netflix and everything looks good, again once colour was adjusted to add a bit more contrast. Overall, its fast, responsive and has handled everything I have thrown at it with ease. I use it for Office applications and some of the Adobe suite of programs, mostly illustrator and it has been more than adequate for that. The keyboard is fine with plenty of travel, its very light and extremely portable. I have not tried any games on it so I can not vouch for the graphics card. I would definitely recommend it though, its a very reasonable price!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Bought for my daughter to take to university and she loves it - It seemed to be the most cost-effective for the performance and when we weighed up the compromises, vs the most expensive offerings out there, it made a lot of sense - The only questionable design decision is the flap which covers half of one of the USB slots and has to be flicked out the way to use - I have no idea why!!! But not enough to detract from an overall excellent computer."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Pros: I bought this laptop as a student wanting a lightweight portable Macbook alternative and boy does it deliver! It has next to no problems rendering large cad files, smoothly edits video with no lag. The bang and olufson speakers are phenomenal as the audio practically surrounds you and immerses you! Battery life is amazing on \"Best Battery life\" mode, streamed a two hour film on it and it only went down to 60% very happy! I was surprised at the size of the letters on the keys at first as they are quite large compared to other laptops however its easy to forget and actually helpfull if you have bad eyesight!\nCons: The fingerprint reader is a bit hit and miss as it doesn't always work."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"It met all my expectations. I am glad I made the perfect choice.\nPros: lightweight, compactible for heavy multitasking because of the processor, slick design, suitable for 3d apps and softwares and everything you hoped it could do and more.\nCons: the keyboard lights aren’t visible in some dark settings (black would have been the best), not compactible with games that requires high graphics video card (like nvidia gtx), having problems with the mouse because of the slimness of the bezel causing friction on the mouse when holding the laptop with one hand while operating with the other. The fingerprint scanner works well only when you get the hand position correctly. Maybe with time I will start getting it. Lol"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Pros:\nCompact - It's about the size of an A4 pad of paper.\nStrong - It feels strong and has an aluminium frame (not unibody, but precision engineering regardless)\nCooling design - When you open the lid, it raises the back of the laptop allowing hot air to escape underneath and behind.\nFingerprint scanner - If you have a modern phone you'll probably already appreciate why this is good.\nDedicated graphics - Not the most powerful in the world but it's just enough to add a bit of bite to this device. Don't expect to be playing the latest PC gaming titles on this.\nSSD - It's very snappy.\nBattery - It has lasted me a full day of basic browsing and about 6 hours of web development.\nTouchscreen - I don't use it much but sometimes you just want to slide something with your finger and it's suddlenly a nice to have.\nCons:\nTrackpad - The trackpad can be hit or miss, get a bluetooth mouse. I wish I could take off half a star for this but since Amazon only works in whole stars, and I see more good than bad, I have to give it a pass.\nNoteworthy:\nKeyboard - The layout took a little getting used to, I think due to the size rather than layout but it is backlit and the keys feel good.\nUSB-C - The USB-C is not thunderbolt 3 from what I understand.\nCharger - The charger is smaller than most. It's built like an Apple Macbook charger, except it doesn't use USB-C to charge."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Very happy with the laptop, it’s lightweight, boots quickly and the battery life is great so far.\nThe only downside/problem is that nine times out of ten, the finger print scanner doesn’t work, despite re-scanning my print a number of times."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought this high spec laptop primarily for photo and video editing using Photo Director and Power Director editing software.

CPU often 100%. but others are great"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"A bit to quick when you scroll down."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Outstanding performance"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I’ve thoroughly enjoyed testing this laptop. There are perhaps better ultraportables out there, notably the Dell XPS 13, but only if you have very deep pockets. This one from HP may not be perfect (nor is the Dell) but offers all most people will need. I love the Envy’s compact dimensions and especially its low weight – just a little over 1.2 kgs.\nThe first thing you notice, on unboxing, is the very smart cast aluminium body. Open it up and the screen has Gorilla glass side-to-side and top-to-bottom. There are bezels around the display, under the glass, but it still looks classy. This is an elegant laptop.\nPerformance-wise, with its i5-8250U processor, few people will want more. It’seven capable of light gaming, given the on-board GeForce MX150 graphics card. The fan only kicks in under heavy load, so the machine is quiet, most of the time.\nThe memory is soldered in place, so can’t be upgraded, but 8 GB is all you really need. The 256GB SSD is too small for anyone with a collection of photos and music, let alone videos. It can be swapped, as long as you’re confident and read the Maintenance and Service Guide (available, along with the User Guide, on the HP website), but you'll invalidate the warranty in the process.\nThe 1920x1080 display is sharp. Brightness could be greater for use outdoors but is no problem otherwise. I’m not sure the colours are quite 100% accurate, so this may not be a machine for enthusiast photo/video editors. On the plus side, it offers multi-touch – very useful. For general use, including movie watching and casual photo/video editing, no one is likely to complain about the display.\nThe keyboard is excellent, with nicely spaced keys and good feedback. Opening the display makes the keyboard tip forward a little, to make typing more comfortable. I was delighted to find that there are dedicated keys for things like PrtSc, PgUp, PgDn, Home and End – no need to use the Fn key. I wish the Enter key were bigger but I’ll get used to it. The fingerprint key, unusually, is on the right side of the machine instead of the keyboard, but it works well.\nThe touchpad is accurate and responsive. There’s no Microsoft Precision support, so you don’t get the full range of gestures, but few users will be bothered. The speakers are impressive for a laptop of this size but inevitably lack a little bass..\nBattery life doesn’t match the claims but, with light use, will see you through a full day. You need to carry the charger for more-intensive use, but at least it’s pretty quick to charge (they’re not wrong when they claim charging to 50% in 45 minutes, but it does then slow down).\nThere’s a pretty good selection of ports. The single USB-C port is non-Thunderbolt, if that matters to you. The two USB-A 3.1 ports are welcome. Then there’s Displayport, headphone/mic, micro-SD, and charge. A USB-C to HDMI adapter is included in the box. I’ll miss full-size SD, and a second USB-C would have been welcome, but otherwise I’m happy. It’s easy enough to buy adapters for SD and Ethernet, if you need them. At my desk, I use a USB-C hub that gives me Ethernet, HDMI, SD and extra USB-A and USB-C ports.\nI’ve deliberately picked out this laptop’s imperfections but in fact it represents something of an Ultraportable bargain, at less than £850. I’m delighted with the Envy and strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I'm reviewing this sort of on behalf of my 65-year-old dad, who is just about computer savvy but definitely uses a computer in ways I wouldn't. Im all video editing, connectivity, downloading, music production programs....he's more about an easy life. He's the type to read spam email and passes time on it by playing solitaire. We've gone through a fair few laptops for various reasons - too heavy, too big, too slow, doesn't work...just to paint a picture of what type of person this laptop needs to please in this instance!\nSo actually, reviewing it for him and not me, i'm actually really impressed with it.\nIt almost seems, in size and design certainly, like a small Macbook, but for those who want a Windows system.\nThere's a lot I could say about Windows 10 but i'll leave that out completely. Focusing on the laptop...\nSo as I said, if I was using it, i'd want something more - but like everything, you have to weigh up your uses to determine appropriation.\nThe screen is fantastically clear. It's like the TV section of John Lewis with the ultra 4K clarity. In regards to watching programs on it, they'll always suffer poor internet connection buffering so you might not get a program that matches the photo sharpness of it, but it's ideal for my dad with poor eyesight to have it this sharp and clear.\nAnother favourite thing on the physical side is that they're nice big keys, nice big keys for nice big fingers. The touch screen is useful though thankfully HP haven't relied on it being the sole usage point - you can completely get away with not using it at all - again for the likes of my dad who shuns the whole touchscreen fiasco, a 'generational thing'.\nLightweight, portable, fits in most bags. Another win. Most of his usage is internet browsing, downloading unusual programs like TomTom updater and Google Earth, and the odd use of Excel if he's working away. The most important things for him were strong internet connectivity, and to be honest, just ease of use. The 8gb RAM is more than enough as he's not doing anything processor heavy like rendering on photoshop or making videos, it's all low to medium CPU stuff like Word, Excel, Chrome, Spotify...even with all of them open at the same time, no struggles at all. It boots up fast if you leave everything open and just close the lid, and now that i've set up fingerprint security for him, he's thankful for not having the 'pain' of remembering passwords anymore.\nThe 256GB memory again, is suitable for purpose. It wouldn't even bother me too much as I run most things off hard drives and use the computer as a component base, but even for my dad, it's more than enough for files, photos, the odd video, heaps of random manuals downloaded off the internet. I think generally this laptop would struggle if you were considering gaming, but for nearly all other applications outside of games, video editing and music production, it should be fine.\nThe lack of ports that all laptops seem to be having these days is somewhat annoying, my only downfall on this is the one USB port, another would have been really useful. It has a Type-C port but my problem with the lack of anything is that the adapters are really annoying to carry round and not lose, even more so considering Type-C adapters can be pricey. You now need an adapter for everything these days because they just won't build them in to the laptops. So another USB would have been nice, but...it's really only one downfall.\nThere's also no disc drive. Again, old hat technology that also takes up a lot of space in the innards and hence why they don't put them in anymore, but sometimes I think the one benefit of laptops and computers over tablets or phones is that it's got a disc drive. Software updates, DVD's then routed in to a TV, personalised photo slideshows...there's a lot some people still use discs for. It's a shame really.\nSome thoughts:\nLike all Lithium batteries, they have a memory, so the best practice with them is to fully charge for the very first time, then let them completely drain each time before recharging - batteries have a 'memory' so if you recharge when it's on 35%, it'll remember being empty at around that if done enough times.\nI'd recommend a screen protector, the UHD screen is much like the modern Apple iPhone screens - wonderful, but smash easily. I've just got a hunch. And unlike iPhones, I imagine this £800 laptop probably isn't as easy or cheap to get screen repaired.\nOverall, fantastic. I think it's designed as an everyday all-rounder, and as long as it's seen as that, I think it's brilliant. Travels easy, holds it's battery power, connects easily, works."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This arrived on time with no problems. Does what it says on the tin. I use it for video calling a lot and the webcam (I am told) is better quality than the separate one I am using on my PC. It picks up light very well and I can use it in a dark room with no issues, great for people in LDR's!\nStart up is fast and the touch screen is great if you're feeling a bit lazy. I haven't really done much else on it but I am very happy with my purchase, its fast, its lightweight and it has all of the little features that make it easy to use (backlit keyboard, good webcam, fingerprint scanner, touchscreen etc)."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is a really lightweight and compact laptop. It's a step above the netbooks that was all the rage several years ago. It's got a slightly bigger screen size than the netbooks, but is thinner and lighter. The size, look and feel is almost comparable to the smaller MacBooks. It's perfect for home use, accounting, storing photos, writing documents, managing emails, watching movies. With a medium grade processor and SSD it boots up very quickly, considering it's running the latest Windows Home Operating System. The hardware specification is comparable to a basic desktop PC, so it has enough resources to install most home/accounting/office software, and all packed into one portable device. From new the battery charges quickly and the charger is slim, so makes the laptop even more portable. The build in the hardware is what really sells this laptop, the keyboard is soft, low profile with subtle feedback. The speakers are Bang & Olufsen and have a very good audio output. The laptop also has a camera built into the top of the screen, it does struggle in low light but is sufficient for use with video messaging. The screen has a glossy reflective finish, and displays photos, graphics and colours with satisfying brightness, crispness and high saturation. The screen is touch capacitive, and does unfortunately attract greasy fingerprints. The fingerprint reader takes some getting used to and is less receptive compared to other devices I've used. Initial set up with Windows 10 has its flaws, but the operating software is not what this review is about. A quirk with this design is that the back of the screen, serves as an elevation point for the laptop when fully opened. I feel this may look edgy but could compromise the opening mechanism after much use. The specification of this laptop is more than enough for home and leisure use, the build and quality of the components is what makes the laptop feels superior to the lower end models."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought this in the Black Friday sales and have absolutely no regrets. I have the i5/256GB SSD/MX150 variant.\nPERFORMANCE:\nIn terms of gaming, I have no complaints. I game lightly (SIMS 4 and Football Manager 2019) and have no issues with lag at all. Both games run at close to or on 60 fps.\nBUILD:\nThe build quality is superb. Metal, lovely corners, nice tree-like design panel on the back, thin, portable. Has that ergonomic design so it tilts when opened for easier desk use. Love it.\nDISPLAY:\nThe screen is nice, perhaps could be a little brighter outside, but inside it's never an issue. Crisp imagery and good colours when gaming/watching videos. Small bezels around it make it seem minimalistic. It's not a MAJOR feature but it's more than good.\nUSER EXPERIENCE:\nRuns Windows 10 like a dream and the touchscreen is something I never thought I needed, until I had it. Now I can't go without it and feel at a loss on my desktop PC. So convenient.\nBATTERY:\nExcellent when operating daily, 5-7 hours dependant on what you're doing. When gaming consistently I achieved around 3-3.5 hours before low battery warning. It charges extremely quickly, from low to full in just over an hour.\nOVERALL:\nI would highly recommend, from my research the Envy 13 is pretty much the best bang for your buck ultrabook out there."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I've always been a fan of HP's laptops but they haven't always got things right when it comes to design.  The Envy 13 ah0001na and ah0501sa (both the same laptop) has pretty much got things perfect.\nThe body isn't a unibody like some of Apple's macbooks but it's close enough.  An aluminium body immediately makes this look premium and when you open the laptop up, you get the base of the screen acting as a foot, lifting the base so that it can gain extra air ventilation.  In short, it looks great closed or open and only weighs around 1.3kg, so light to carry around.\nThe keyboard is silver to match the case and is backlit, though the backlighting is white which does make it a little more difficult to see individual keys in certain light.  The keys feel good and are responsive, though there is a small sponginess to the centre of the keyboard.  The trackpad is also responsive and multitouch works well in Windows 10.\nInside you have a fast 8th Generation i5 processor which is pretty much all you should need for powerful processing, plus 8GB low power DDR3 RAM. I would have preferred DDR4 but this is still fast enough for a small laptop.  The star of the show is the MX150 Graphics Card, though. which is around the equivalent of a desktop GTX1030 or just less.  It can play recent games like Far Cry 5 and Tomb Raider in 720p at a minimum of 30fps and older games in 1080p.  Even Forza Horizon 4 ran smoothly at low quality on the laptop.\nThe screen is full HD, has good viewing angles and the panel has some nice strong colours and deep blacks. Overall the picture is very clear.  Watching videos is great while on the move, though the gorilla glass does reflect light a little too much at times.  It's also a touchscreen, though doesn't have support for pens, but it's a nice touch that comes in useful at times when you need to scroll or draw a circle around a piece of work.\nThe 256GB SSD is really fast, loading into Windows is almost instant when you switch on and it's a joy to use with games and apps.  There are also 2 USB 3 ports which are the half hidden type and a USB C which is the fastest you can get and supports video out to TV or monitor. There's a fingerprint sensor on the side next to the USB ports, too, which seems to be fairly accurate, though took a little getting used to in that position.  Battery life is also surprisingly long, 9 hours for productivity work without adding gaming, which is amazing these days for a decent laptop.\nOn first turning on the laptop you're taken through the Windows 10 setup with voice control turned on, which was a nice surprise.  HP have included several full apps which are included on the hard drive including Cyberlink Powerdirector and Photodirector and you can choose to include them or turn them off,  as well as Microsoft Office installed by default.\nI've been using this laptop for a few weeks now and it's pretty wonderful.  Comfy on the lap and good to use on a desk, it can fit in a small bag and is light enough to carry around. It's been fast to start up and has never struggled with apps, I've even been playing the new Far Cry on it quite happily for a few hours.  I'm extremely happy with this device and full marks to HP for their design."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This tiny laptop is absolutely gorgeous.
