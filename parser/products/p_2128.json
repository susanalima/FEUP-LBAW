On my particular product, the keyboard developed a fault whereby keystrokes had to be repeated in order to impact the screen. Despite efforts to return it I eventually replaced it with another manufacturers product."},{"q":"I bought this last year but the transmitter is malfunctioning. Can I replace the transmitter?","a":"Not sure but I would check the manufacturer's warranty as if under a year you may be able to exchange."},{"q":"Can you have two of these in close proximity and they won't interfere with each other when both are in use?","a":"We have 4 in our office we all sit around 2ft away from each other and have not had any issues"},{"q":"What size is the mouse? I'm after a full sized one around 12cm long.","a":"It is a full sized mouse - easily handled and precise."},{"q":"How noisy are the keys when typing?

The keyboard on the Microsoft Wireless Desktop 2000 is dreadful. The entire thing flexes when used with the rear extensions raised, and the spacebar seems to be a total hit and miss, not always working, with a dreadful tinny click.\nThe mouse is also not the same as the one shipped with the Wireless Desktop 3000 (now called 3050). We also have a Microsoft Wireless Comfort Desktop 5050 which has the same Bluetrack  mouse as the 3050. The mouse that ships with the Desktop 2000 is not the same and feels a lot less substantial in the hand.\nMy advice is to go for the Wireless Desktop 3050 \nor  Wireless Comfort Desktop 5050, \n which only cost a little more.\nDo not make the same mistake I did and assume that the quality would be similar across the product range."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"I bought this keyboard, mouse, and dongal on April 3, 2018, and it quit working August 15, 2018.  When I plugged it into my PC it wasn't working and we had to try other ports.  Finally one of the ports worked.  It was great until August 15, 2018, and it just stopped working.  The batteries were changed for new, and I restarted my PC but nothing worked.  My PC could no longer locate it.  I am very disappointed.  And I cannot return it for a refund since the refund date passed in one month.  Microsoft will not give me a refund since I did not buy it from them.  They would have given me a two-year warranty.  And now it appears Amazon will not refund me either.  I bought from Amazon because it was £30 and from Microsoft it was £52.99.  Perhaps I should have bought direct from Microsoft."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Purchased for use in the office as I already have another Microsoft Wireless Keyboard and Mouse at home.\nThis set, the Wireless Desktop 2000, doesn't disappoint and lives up to the standard I have come to expect from Microsoft hardware over the years.\nBoth the keyboard and mouse are what I would call \"full size\" so are well suited to all-day usage. Build quality is excellent with all key and button presses feeling nice and positive and a nice smooth scroll action on the mouse wheel.\nInstallation on Windows 10 is as straightforward as plugging in the USB receiver and popping the batteries (included) into the Keyboard and Mouse.\nAll of the standard keyboard keys will work without any additional software being installed. If you wish to use the additional customisable keys at the top of the keyboard, or reconfigure some of the other keyboard functions, it's a simple case of downloading the Microsoft Keyboard and Mouse Center application from the Microsoft website and using the straightforward interface to tailor the keyboard to your needs.\nThe keyboard and mouse also work fine as a standard keyboard on Mac and Linux systems."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought this mouse and keyboard combo for my media PC.  With other mouse and keyboards I have had issues with signal strength but with this set I have not had a single problem.  The mouse has BlueTrack technology and works on almost every surface you have to offer.  Must importantly this combo features AES which means the keyboard and mouse are linked to the dongle.  Therefore, neither interfers with my other Microsoft wireless mouse which I have for my laptop in the same room.\nOverall, a very good product for the price.  There is nothing wrong with this product.  The only reason to spend more money is for something smaller or more stylish."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Bought to replace MS Wireless Keyboard & Mouse 3000, after the dongle gave up the ghost.\nPros:\n+ Comfortable and sturdy\n+ Lots of extra buttons (volume +/-, calculator, e-mail, homepage, 5 user-defined favourites etc.)\n+ Mouse works on almost any surface (leather couch armrest, jeans, wooden floor, glass tabletop)\nCons:\n- No forward/back buttons on mouse\n- No mute button beside volume controls\n- Dongle is quite big; inconvenient for use with laptops\n- All the (sometimes) useful extra buttons take room from 'ESC' and 'F' keys, meaning they seem unnecessarily small, which is annoying if using them often (e.g. Excel or certain games) They also don't have the traditional gaps between F4 & F5 and F8 & F9\nThe cons may seem insignificant - and to some I'm sure they are - but since this is a newer model than the set I was replacing, I wasn't really expecting them to take a couple of steps backwards by removing useful things. The mute button is no big deal but the lack of extra buttons on the mouse seems like a major oversight.\nIf you need a good sturdy wireless keyboard and mouse, it should be fine. If you want all the bells and whistles, particularly more than the standard three mouse buttons, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"Nice keyboard and mouse, however, it gave up after a month and no longer works."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This Microsoft keyboard looks and feels fantastic. I bought this for my office at work and it so far it has been great. The keys don’t make too much noise when typing and it has a good span, not too big or small. The calculator quick function is very useful as well as the hot keys, especially during busy times. The mouse has a good grip and is a good mouse. I sometimes eat lunch at my desk, and the keyboard does get dirty. But it is not hard to clean."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"after using a ton of keyboards & mice over the years I settled upon almost identical wired versions of this keyboard & mouse as my choice product, when I found out they sold both of these as a package in wireless form I was a very happy man, I own 2 sets & love them, they work flawlessly. Only changed batteries in 1 mouse so far they lasted 4 months of constant daily use!. The mouse works great on almost any surface. For perfect operation have the usb dongle in line of sight, I use a short usb extension cable to the desktop, I did have slight issues when it was under the desk. Both keyboard & mouse have that very standard/ workhorse design to them but subtly smoothed out to just the right amount, very well designed, extremely strong durable construction, made to withstand heavy daily use. For me this product is perfection"},{"rating":"2.0","content":"Not happy with the mouse in this bundle - the mouse wheel isn't \"notched\", so it is a smooth scroll rather than the more lumpy type I'm used to.  This in itself would be something I'd get used to, but I found when using a number of applications the zoom or page position (depends on the app) would change by itself.  It is like the wheel is moving itself (which I know it isn't), so the app zooms in and out randomly... very annoying.\nFYI - rated battery and durability as 4 stars as I've no idea what they're like yet?!"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I've wanted a decent wireless keyboard and mouse for months.  The last time I bought one, which was several years ago, the Logitech unit I ended up with was one of the worst keyboards I've ever used and I was anxious not to end up in the same situation.  I narrowed it down to this, the Microsoft Wireless Desktop 3000 (which seems to have more features but is the same price...weird) and an Anker wireless keyboard/mouse bundle.\nIt arrived bent out of shape, so one corner of the keyboard was higher than the other...a bit like when a table has a wonky leg.  A little brute force to bend the entire plastic casing a little and it was almost as good as new, so I could type without the entire keyboard tilting back and forth.  Not a great start, but all's well that ends well.  Both keyboard and mouse come with branded batteries which is good, with the mouse using 2 x AAs and the keyboard using 2 x AAAs; the 2 AAs in the mouse makes it nicely weighted.\nThe mouse is decent, fairly comfortable and the plastic casing doesn't feel too cheap.  The scroll wheel is smooth (i.e. you can't feel tiny ridges as you turn the wheel, like you can with some other mice...personally, I prefer this) but 'stiff' enough to be completely controllable.  The wheel can also be clicked down, left and right (all of which appear to be configurable).\nThe keyboard is also pretty decent.  It has a wrist rest which works but is made of hard, cheap feeling plastic (as is the entire keyboard).  The keys are non-mechanical so are soft and reasonably quiet (apart from the space bar, which makes much more noise than every other key).  You can configure all the function keys but you have to then use the Fn key to activate the custom function.  It would be nice to be able to set this on or off and I think you can do this with the 3000 version of this set.  There are also several soft-keys which you can assign functions without having to use another key combination; these are useful but very stiff to press...much, much more so than the other keys.  It could simply be because it's new but only time will tell.\nNow the not so good...\nThe mouse feels too small.  I've always used one of the old Microsoft Intellimouse units until now and I suppose the new wireless mouse will take a bit of getting used to; it's shorter than my old corded Intellimouse which (at the moment, at least) feels awkward.\nThere's no getting away from the fact the the keyboard feels cheap.  There's an abundance of single use and customisable keys which to me are just gimmicks.  Do I really need a key whose sole purpose is to open the Windows calculator?  Probably not.  One of the worst things about this keyboard is the keys' decals are very reflective.  This means that if you have overhead lighting (such as halogen downlighters), it's very difficult to see some of the decals, dependent on where the light falls, because they reflect the light back into your eyes.  During the day or with ambient light, it's fine but something to bear in mind.\nWhen all's said and done, I'm still tempted to return it and try something else"},{"rating":"2.0","content":"Unlike so many other wireless keyboards and mice, this model only Works with Windows or MAC OS. The receiver is not a nice compact unit like Logitech so not so cool for Laptops where you'd want to leave the receiver plugged in. The Keyboards seems to have a profile which makes the front row rather proud compared with most and I keep mistyping. I'm sure I'll get used to it but since I bought this for my Raspberry PI which it won't work with its likely to find itself in the bin.\nThe keyboard feels cheep. Not too noisy, but doesn't feel like it would take much hammer before breaking and now I'm getting quite annoyed as I keep mistyping.\nThe mouse is a big disappointment. It takes two AA batteries making it pretty heavy. Doesn't bode well for long battery life if it needs two unlike Logitech which uses one and lasts over a year. The other annoyance is the wheel button which is smooth rolling and requires a heavy press, not much use if you play first person shooters as I do and use the wheel for weapon selection, you may just find the game flips to using a rocket launcher when your trying to shoot a bad guy at point blank with a shot gun. Much preferred Microsoft's Intellimouse which has been my preferred mouse forever. Seems every new product which boasts greater features always turns out to be a backward step. I don't think Microsoft ever perform Human factors analysis to anything they do, otherwise we wouldn't end up with Windows 8. Anyway, for the price OK so long as you plan to use it with Windows or MAC and can tolerate a large dongle in your USB port and a long self driver installation, and you want a mouse which will work on your clothing."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"One very major flaw with the keyboard is lack of CAPS lock notification. Such a basic but key thing to miss. The function keys are very narrow too.\nIt is so annoying when you can type in wrong password again without realising.  Should have done with Logitech 520 at same price. Mouse is ok - a bit on the heavy side but I'm ok with. Encryption is a good feature.\nEDIT - Upgraded to 4 start - Install the latest version of IntelliPoint (v8.2) to be able to see on screen notification of caps lock."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"A really nice well bought out item which is designed to be comfortable to use and easy to set up\nMy only gripe with this is that although it is built well and feels good value and works well it has intermittent stages where it can mid keystrokes to a solid four stars"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I have owned this keyboard/mouse set for about two years.  The set is very nice in terms of its functionality.  The keyboard is a full-sized keyboard but not overly large or heavy, so it doesn't take up too much space or feel too bulky.  I can easily pick this up and use it in multiple places around my computer.  The keyboard also has a nice set of extra buttons (to launch extra programs, control music/video playback, and adjust volume) that I frequently use.  Moreover, the keyboard is set up so that the extra butons are placed at the top; I do not need to worry about accidentially hitting something like I did when I used my previous keyboard (a Logitech wireless keyboard).  The mouse is a standard 3-button mouse that seems a little small for my hand, but it has worked for the most part.  The received is OK; it works over a few meters, but it doesn't work well if inserted into a rear port on a desktop computer.\nWhile the keyboard has held up well over two years, the mouse is beginning to disintegrate.  The padding went about a year ago, and the pads shredded the surface underneath it until I peeled them off.  Now the rubberized surfaces are disintegrating.  This is a particular problem with the rubber belt on the outside of the scroll wheel, which is on the verge of coming off, which would make it difficult to use.  As it is, the scroll wheel has become more stiff recently.\nOverall, this is a decent product.  The keyboard is simple but nice to use and will probably last another year at least.  The mouse, however, was not quite as good and may be approaching the end of its life."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I'm not sure if I misordered, but the quality of this keyboard and mouse isn't as good as previous ones I've bought (800 model), including one working on my other computer right now. This one is about an inch deeper due to an additional row of function keys and a slightly larger heel rest. Disappointed to see that the useful volume controls on my 800 have been relocated and actually I can't see the + and - volume controls on this one.\nAs for the mouse, this is far from the best quality Microsoft mouse. Like the keyboard this is labelled model 2000. It's overly large and annoyingly the scroll wheel lacks a ratchet feedback, so feels a little vague compared to the model 1000. Definitely a retrograde step. The model 3500 mouse is the one to go for if you have a choice, although I'm not sure it's available as a keyboard/mouse combination.\nUltimately I guess the proof is how long it lasts. Although these Microsoft units seem fairly reliable they certainly don't seem to go on forever, as the wireless side seems to fail after a couple of years."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Just taken delivery of this product (one day after ordering so great service). Keyboard is terrific, no worries, but the mouse! Very lively with a mind of its own. Simply doesn't do what you want it to do and as I work with a lot of complex spreadsheets I need pinpoint accuracy. So, I'm keeping the item as the keyboard is brill but not going to use the mouse which means my old mouse is plugged back in (I only really wanted the keyboard anyway so no problems for me, but if you need both then you might be disappointed).\nReally surprised that a world-class company like Microsoft allowed this to get through product development."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Keyboard is good to use, easy on the hand mouse. Not sure on battery life yet as i Have not had it long enough, but I have bought an Amazonbasics battery 4 piece charger for when the need arises. All packs away out of sight when not in use. Way better than another brand that I had before, it not cost half as much and was useless."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"I bought this keyboard and mouse earlier this year. A month or so ago I noticed that the keys need bashing or they don't react,don't print the letter. I don't think that a keyboard should need such a physical force. The mouse is losing its responsiveness,sometimes the pointer does not move until I tap the mouse a few times. Not impressed."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"I needed a replacement keyboard (the mouse was OK but worked through the same sender) and this took my fancy.  It works fine however the delete key seems to be in the wrong place and the keys are just a bit too \"springy\".  All in all however its functional and allows me to type away from my lap-top.\nUp-date - February 2015.  The USB dongle gave up the ghost this week and is no longer recognised by the Window's OS (7 Ultimate).  There appears to be no way of simply replacing this so its junk the lot and look for something new.  Not exactly lasted the course so have downgraded it to 2 stars."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I have to say, I like the keyboard part of this set a lot; I find it much more substantial and more comfortable to use than my old Logitech one, and the extra function keys are useful.  But the mouse really lets it down.  It is too big and high for me (I have average sized hands and arthritis), and makes my hand ache after quite a short period of use. Gaming is almost impossible, partly because of the size and partly because I can't find a surface that I can use it on to give me a good, controllable motion.  A plain wooden surface causes too much traction, a polished one too little.  The scroll wheel is also very poor.  It works too fast, shooting to the bottom of the page at the least touch, when I am working on my own documents: but it works very slowly and unreliably, if at all, on web pages. So browsing is also spoiled by it.  At least it can be switched off to save battery power (unlike the keyboard).\nOn the technical side, the mouse uses 2 x AA batteries and the keyboard 2 x AAA ones (Duracell ones were supplied with the set).  The keyboard measures about 44 cm in length, 18 in width, and with the feet extended stands about 3 cm high.  The mouse is 11 cm by 5 cm by 3.5 cm."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"At £23.99, this keyboard is brilliant! The mouse is alright, but I have some problems with it (paaragraph 2)\nMy previous keyboard was a lot more simple than this one - spaced out keys, noisy keys, no media buttons, etc. This keyboard is almost the opposite but I definitely prefer it! It makes virtually no sound at all when you're typing which is great for working (or gaming!) at night when everybody else is trying to sleep, and also the keys in the vertical-middle of the keyboard are slightly lower than the others which makes typing a lot more comfortable. The rest is of a good quality although I haven't really used it because I am not used to having one! There's plenty of media buttons at your disposal which I'll have to play around with but I doubt I'll use them much.\n+ comfortable\n+ quiet\n+ plenty of extra buttons!\n- esc, f1-f12, prtscn, scrlk, pause and the calculator are all buttons rather than keys which could be against your liking.\n- no Caps Lock light to say if it's on or off, but there is a visual screen notification telling you this. I prefer lights :)\nThe mouse, on the other hand, isn't quite as good. It's a comfortable shape and the right sort of size for a fifteen-year-old's hand and I have no complaints on it's surface ability due to the \"Bluetrack Technology\", but the wheel of the mouse isn't really to my liking. I've only ever had two mice in my lifetime so I don't know if this is the new design of mouse or something but the wheel hasn't got any grooves or notches so it's a little less precise when scrolling. I had to install the microsoft software (which, by the way, was ridiculously easy to do) and managed to make the scrolling more precise but having no bumps in the wheel is definitely a problem for me.\n+ comfortable\n+ sensitive\n+ software makes scrolling and movement easy to customize to your liking\n- wheel has no notches so scrolling isn't as nice as my previous mouse\n- don't expect to present it on a \"best looking mouse\" show, because it's rather boring. Black and grey is worse than just black.\nSo, for £23.99, this is a damn good keyboard. I looked around for weeks on amazon at Logitech and Microsoft keyboards and I'm glad I took so long reading all the reviews to see the problems and benefits. Thank you to all those who took the time to write reviews and those who marked the good ones as helpful, it really helped me choose this wonderful package.\n(It's 4 stars because of the mouse's minor fault - a 5 star product shouldn't have any)"},{"rating":"1.0","content":"This mouse/keyboard combo has to be the most woefully poor piece of hardware I have ever purchased.\nI have bought several of these for my place of work, and am now bored with trying to send them back and simply throw them in the bin.

Works fine for a while then simply packs up. Tried changing batteries, troubleshooting via the internet. Nothing. The easy answer is to simply throw it away and get something of a better quality e.g. Logitech (again, in my experience)"},{"rating":"2.0","content":"The keyboard is great but the mouse isn't the best if I'm honest as it struggles to track accurately on our smooth wood laminate worktops in the office where Logitech Laser mice have no problem.\nMake sure you install the Microsoft software so you can customise all the keys and buttons on the keyboard."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"No off switch for Keyboard, otherwise very happy. Batteries that came with the set still lasting after 2 months, and the keyboard feels smooth to use and not loud at all to type on. Mouse is a good heavy-ish weight so it feels very responsive. Mouse works really well on all surfaces, including your jeans/trousers if you're a lazy user !\nUPDATE; Was using the keyboard for an extended period of time, so never unplugged the USB adapter.

Great for chatting, skype or IM when you can just sit back and relax giving you a much more comfortable and natural conversation. Also clears desk space as you can have this on your lap or put it to one side when you need to write something down. Keyboard has a nice, comfortable hand rest with a comfortable texture to prevent wrist/hand injuries.

There is nothing wrong with the keyboard either."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"It worked pretty well when I got it although bigger than anticipated. Easy to install. The dongle doesn't clip away neatly so easy to lose in a bag etc, so I wouldnt recommend if you're moving about lots, I've had more compact ones which are better. The battery life isn't great and it's annoying that you can't turn the keyboard off like the mouse. The worst part is after using it for 6 months it lost the dongle signal and wont sync or get picked up so now useless. There is no reset button on any of the parts so now useless and a waste of money."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"Bought as a replacement for another wireless set which broke.\nThe keyboard is comfortable and quiet, but I felt that the space between the directional keys and the main part of the keyboard was far too small. The buttons at the top of the keyboard didn't work with windows 8 or 10 for anything. May be of much more use on Windows 7 but didn't get the chance to try.\nAfter minimal use (around once a week) for around a year many of the keys stopped working. Replacing the batteries didn't fix the issue so I had to replace this one too.\nThe mouse, however, is really comfortable and still going strong. At least the receiver will still be of use, it is very basic but nice to use."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"The keyboard was perfectly OK, but the mouse had both design and manufacturing faults, all to do with the scroll wheel:\nUnlike all other mice I've had before (other than the Microsoft 5000 mouse, which has the same problem), the scrolling was not the \"ratchet\" type.  This may sound fine, but it's really easy to move the scroll wheel as you centre-click, resulting in the mouse not recognising the click.\nThe centre click needs a really hard press (again like the 5000) which just exacerbates the above problem and can also quickly give you cramp in your finger.\nThe centre scroll wheel \"grated\" for part of the way round its rotation.\nI returned this within hours, and the Amazon return and refund process is second to none.  Within two hours of dropping it off at the Post Office I had the money back in my account."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Keyboard great but found mouse to be a touch too tall for me and not at all comfortable.
