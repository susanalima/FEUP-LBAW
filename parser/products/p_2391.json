Never had a Dell, always had HP, stands comparison well. Does everything I ask of it. Great value for money. Would definitely use again."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This has been a great purchase for the price. Arrived quickly and well packaged, and has been faultless since, am using this at a work premises for basic duties and have experienced no problems at all - no issues at all in getting it up and running, and has worked flawlessly since purchase. Highly recommended, and would definitely buy again."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Perfect budget machine for hooking up to a telly, and media keyboard. Some minor issues - i) came with a clover lead, whereas it needed an iec, ii) the dvd module wasn't fitted properly, and had slipped back into the case, iii) the front facing fan had quite a bit of dust packed in, however these were easily remedied. I would have removed a star for these, but...the DVD is RW ! Have the star back ! It also seems to have a choice of Win7 or Win10. I am still generally sticking to Win7 on other computers, so its nice to have a budget one to practice Win10 on.\nThe niggles might have been frustrating for somebody not comfortable with opening it up, and not having a spare power lead handy, but for me it is really good, and well worth it."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"This computer has proved to be a complete waste of money! Refurbished? It freezes at least 4 times a day. You need to keep logging in & out eah time, losing any work you were doing. It is really a load of rubbish. Buy new - mores expensive but at least you are buying something that should work."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Fantastic desktop PC base unit as looks brand new and was very easy to set up and use. To verify windows you have to scratch off a small silver panel on the unit to reveal the full licence number (which is explained on a leaflet). The print is very small, so would recommend taking a photo of it on your phone or tablet and enlarging it to read the numbers and enter them to use windows. I also bought a plug in unit from another seller to transfer files off my old desktop drive to this one via the USB socket which was easy to do. Great item at the fraction of the price of a new one."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"We bought this for a 13 year old grandson to replace an old one. Surprisingly well-specced for the money.\nHe is very pleased with the PC and particularly the 64bit version of Windows which was pre-loaded."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"For the second time I received a reconditioned Dell desktop computer through Amazon UK.  The first, delivered to France performed perfectly for 6 years but, after a year in storage during our return to the UK, the hard drive went kaput and I was faced with a £120+ bill for a repair. The new reconditioned Dell received early through Amazon in three days, works just as well as it's predecessor at less than £95 and I could not be happier. My rating of 5 stars is not actually enough to express my satisfaction."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"We were slightly nervous about buying a refurbished PC but usage has proved that our concerns were unnecessary.
