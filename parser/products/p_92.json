They are superb nimble mice and weigh only 85g.\nThe G305 uses the same shell as these the only difference I can see is a slightly smaller dpi button.\nThe G pro uses a variant of the Avago 3360 sensor which is the best on the market at present. The G305 uses the new HERO sensor and as far as I can tell it performs the same. I have always avoided wireless mice due to two issues. Firstly they can suffer from lag and secondly the batteries make them too heavy for gaming - I like light mice. After playing with this mouse I can find no lag - the mouse seems just as responsive as my G Pro. This is due to the Lightspeed technology Logitech has been developing the last few years.\nAs regards the weight this is where the new HERO sensor comes in. Although it performs like a 3360 it is much more power efficient. This means powering it with replaceable AA batteries becomes feasible. Logitech say one AA battery lasts about 250 hours. However this is in gaming mode. If you set it to low power for desktop use it will last for nine months says Logitech.\nThe mouse is designed for an AA battery and comes with a Duracell. However Energiser Lithiums are lighter and last longer. I've gone one step further and use a AAA Energiser Lithium in a AAA to AA converter. This keeps the weight down to about 85g same as the G Pro and also improves the balance slightly.\nThe mouse uses the Logitech software suite which I think is the best there is. I set my dpi etc then switch it to \"onboard mode\" so the internal memory retains the settings. The receiver is a small USB dongle. Mine is plugged in fairly close to the mouse and as I said I have no issues with lag or latency. However Logitech also provide an extension lead if you need to get the receiver closer to the mouse.\nThe buttons feel the same as the G Pro. Left and right main buttons use Logitech's spring tensioning system which results in fast, light clicks. Side buttons are fine and the scroll wheel has a fairly strong click.\nIn summary this is a breakthrough product in my opinion. It performs like a wired mouse and weighs the same. However it has the convenience of not needing an annoying cable which keeps snagging on the pad or desk. I think the price is ridiculous - I think the mouse would still be good value at double the price. The only downside is the lack of bling.
