The keys are far from silent but there's no clunk. The keys are easy to press and have a nice travel, comfortable for touch typing. I have had another previously (the K120 has been around for many years) and after some wear the keys became more 'clacky' but all the better for typing on.\nI noticed Some have mentioned that the layout is strange or they dislike the shape. I'm very fussy with keyboards, they have to be generic and of a standard layout. This fits the bill perfectly so I'm not sure what problems others are having unless they're not used to a bog standard layout.\nVery lightweight but doesn't fee tool flimsy. The rubber feet are just enough to stop it sliding around and the cable is not excessively long. Perfect for me to use around the house and it often comes to and from work in my bag.\nReally minor note not related to the keyboard performance itself - the keyboard has the new style Logitech logo in the top right rather than \"K120\" as shown in the image. This is just as Logitech have updated their branding."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Overall I'm quite impressed with this cheap keyboard. The keys are soft to the touch, not necessarily silent but quiet none the less, especially compared to the keyboard it replaced.\nAs a programmer i do a lot of typing on my other more expensive keyboard, but i find myself wanting to replace it with this one more and more.\nIt's also pretty small, without being compact and awkward to use. It simply doesn't have buckets of plastic surrounding the outside of the keyboard. So if you have a problem with space it may be ideal.\nThey keyboard also feels pretty sturdy, it doesn't bend in the middle like my previous keyboard and it certainly doesn't feel cheap. I don't think I'm the type to punch keyboards anyway, and i don't see how this is any different when used in Windows over any OS....  But then i don't flip out when i use my computer and start smashing my keyboard...\nThose of you having problems with the \" and @ buttons simply have your language settings set wrong in your Operating System. This is completely unrelated to this keyboard, and i can assure that this keyboard does in fact have a standard UK layout.\nAll-in-all I'm very impressed with this cheap and cheerful nice to use keyboard. Logitech all the way."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought this from amazon in September 2015 and it's still working to this day.  I now use a mechanical keyboard as my primary (which is much better, but costs over £100) but the K120 served me well for almost 3 years and is still a perfect backup now.\nOne thing I have noticed with other keyboards is that the more commonly used keys, 'e' for example, can wear down and fade with time but this has not been pronounced on this keyboard, and all the keys are still very visible.\nIt does have quite a plasticky feel to it, and it can rattle on the desk if you are really mashing away at it but for just over £10 it's good to use, easy to type on and I'm sure it could give you 5 years of use without breaking!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought one of these a few years ago. It has served me well and in fact I'm typing on it right now. It's a standard no frills USB keyboard with a good touch to the keys. I recently wanted to replace an old keyboard so, because I cannot find fault with the first one, I bought another identical K120.\nSo if like me you just want a good reliable standard keyboard then, in my opinion, you need look no further."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"My new ZooStrorm PC (which I love) came with a totally useless keyboard (the letters on the keys were unreadable - blue ink on a black keyboard), and none of my old keyboards had a USB connection. So, carefully reading all the Amazon reviews I chose this as the budget keyboard for me, and I am very pleased with it. It has a nice feel to it, and the white writing on the black keys is very clear and easy to read even in poor light. The weird shape of the keyboard isn't quite as pointless as it seems because it allows for a fat space-bar, which is a boon. It also makes it look as though you have paid far more for it than you actually have! Whilst it is not a silent keyboard, it is not annoyingly noisy either."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"For the price this is a brilliant buy. First day or so I kept hitting the wrong keys as it's marginally smaller (layout wise) than the Microsoft one I had before. Bit confused by people complaining about issues in first year of purchase as box says \"3 years manufacturer's guarantee and full product support\".\nAnyway -  I've been using it for a week now and I love it."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Don't believe the hype about whisper-quiet keys.  If you are a \"heavy\" typist it can be quite noisy, especially after using a laptop-type keyboard.\nThe \"pip\" on the J key so that touch typists and the blind can find the home keys should be bigger.  I can barely feel it.  Luckily I don't need it, but I know people who do.\nBut all the keys work, which is a great improvement on the one I bought from the big UK chain formerly known as Dixons recently."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"...because I love old-fashioned, clicky keyboards. But this one is such a joy for me to use. And mind you, I have a mid-2010 13\" MacBook Pro that I use it with. And when I get a new MacBook Pro, I will keep using this keyboard. It's loud and clicky (exactly what I want), it's very simple and elegant, and it's just durable. I can't think of a better keyboard for me. Too bad Apple doesn't make external keyboards like this but macOS remaps CTRL, CMD, and OPTION fairly easily."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Needed to replace my old reliable key board but did not want to spend too much and took a chance on this as it is a named brand. Glad I did it is just as good as more expensive key board with a nice feel and key feedback for someone who is not a skilled typist."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"After my partner had no luck with low quality microsoft and HP keyboards we thought we'd try logitech for a change for a cheap keyboard as he is not a fan of gaming/specialist keyboards.\nFrom the moment we got it out of the box we could tell it was a higher quality. The whole thing feels more sturdy and solid and pressing a key feels tactile with a very pleasant sound. This sounds weird but when you are using it for hours at a time, an annoying keyboard can really get on your nerves.\nWe have had the keyboard for a few months now and it has shown no signs of failing and is still working well. Would recommend as a nice cheap but good quality keyboard."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"This is a no nonsense keyboard. You pay for what you get and this one is very good for the price. The keys have the usual layout  and feel quite firm, so they should take quite a pounding. Booting into safe mode with f8 worked for me, as did entering the BIOS with the DEL key. The keys may be hard to see for some in dimly lit environments, but the answer to that is obvious.\nThe only fly in the ointment for me was the late delivery (two days). I do understand this is down to the supplier and should not put you off the keyboard. Mine was delivered from Mighty Oak Trading and is different from the current supplier advertised I believe. I had two confirmed shipment dates six days apart. It finally arrived two days after the later shipment date and  In total took nine days to arrive after I first placed the order. Not the end of the world, but for some it might be more important. This is why I gave it four stars and not five, to reflect the whole process from start to finish."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I love this keyboard. This one is my third. No problems with the previous ones, just that with prolonged use and exposure to household dust etc a change becomes necessary on hygiene grounds. The feel of this keyboard is great. I can touch type very efficiently on it. It is also good value. I have never had problems, with the operation of the  keyboard, nor with the characters on the keys wearing off."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I was delighted with this product. I do not care who you are but buying a keyboard is never easy. For starters in a lifetime how many do you buy ? Very few indeed. Then there is the price........ and I honestly did not believe that I could buy a keyboard for this price! And what did I have to loose at the price offered ? It arrived, was unpacked  and connected. It has worked perfectly ever since. Yes the keys do not \"click\" as one may have wished nor does it have that heavy feel of a more expensive keyboard but it performs well, is wonderful value for the money. Recommended."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I actually really liked this. I bought it as I have little space for my admin PC in my studio, and I expected to be unimpressed but it would do the job. I actually really like it, though. It's a shame it doesn't have any volume control (which could be accomplished through secondary function keys or a flat dial on the dge of the keyboard) but the text on the keys is large and very clear - Logitech have delivered again."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great value for money keyboard. I created a home office and initially was using a keyboard from work that was around 2 years old and covered in crumbs. For around a tenner this was great and i wish i had bought sooner."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Amazon tells me I bought this keyboard in January 2014.  I'm a programmer so it's used a lot.  It's still going strong, the only problem is I've worn the letters off quite a few of the keys so it's time to buy another one, but after all this time I can't really complain. Great keyboard, great price."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"If you're on the market for a reasonably good and reliable keyboard without any fancy bells and whistles on the cheap, this is your best bet. Had this for more than 2 years and never had an major issues with it. The keyboard does have a little give in that it can bend a little if you hit the keys quite hard like I do, and it's not better than my Sculpt Comfort, but it is a solid keyboard nonetheless. For the price, 4 stars."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Simple and good Value keyboard. I bought this for my 5 year old son, he seems to enjoy using it. Price as reasonable, just lacks any multimedia keys you would expect in a higher priced keyboard. If you are not into gaming, this keyboard should suit your everyday needs."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"This appears to be a good sturdy keyboard  BUT  the reason I bought it was that I had had difficulty typing with the narrow keyboard provided with my recently acquired computer, as the keys/spaces between keys are quite narrow.  When I saw in 'product information' that this Logitech K120 keyboard was 48 cm wide I though there would be more chance that this problem would disappear.  To my considerable surprise, I find that this keyboard is actually 44.5 cm wide  -  why do the suppliers find it reasonable or necessary to lie about this??"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Purchased 15 months ago for light-ish home use.  Ultra reliable, good size, good layout, good feel, robust, low cost (about £11).  Still looks pretty much as new.  If you need a standard wired keyboard, this is an excellent choice.  No hesitation in giving 5 stars."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Pretty good keyboard, i have currently transitioned from a laptop to a PC. I needed a good reliable keyboard to do the job for every day typing, aswell as being used for playing games. Although this keyboard is slightly louder than my laptop, it's pretty comfortable and doesn't take up much space. I have used it for a day so far and pretty pleased with it. I will possibly go for a more expensive option like the 'Corsair Cherry MX Silent Mechanical keyboard' when I have the budget, but until then this will do the job.\nIf any problems occur I will be sure to update my review."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought this after I drowned yet another keyboard.  I haven't had another incident yet so can't verify if it is really spill proof.  I live in hope lol.  It can be difficult to buy an reasonably priced but UK layout spill proof keyboard so this was a good choice. The keys feel good when you are using the keyboard so good for speed typing as well."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I have been using this keyboard for almost two years. I had the one with US layout and this one with UK layout. This keyboard is a basic keyboard which you can't ask for more. Everything about it is good. I even played games with this keyboard and yes, I played tournament games which keyboards are actually kinda important. I don't find it a problem to kick my opponent's asses in Dota, LOL or even BF3. If you are expecting a more than a basic keyboard, you should just go and get some mechanical keyboard instead of browsing for some cheap keyboard. At this price, you can't expect much. Anyway, top quality product at a nice price."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"It's a basic cheap plastic keyboard, but the money's been spent in the right place -- the keyboard action is positive and comfortable. It's not too noisy either. I considered more expensive mechanical keyboards, most of which have unattractive 'gamer' looks, and I've used (noisy) IBM Model M's. I program computers for a living so I type a lot but I'm no touch typist -- actually I'm a bit of a basher. This keyboard suits my typing style just fine!"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Bought it to replace a wireless one that was giving problems. It has a good long lead for the USB connection. Light construction but cheap and so far reliable after a year of regular use."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Got this, thinking it'd be ok based on other reviews. But I wasn't happy with it; just seemed a bit clunky.\nWhat did I expect for less than a tenner?? Decided to buy another (from Amazon of course), but this time a Dell.\nThe Logitech is now the spare.\nThe Dell is a couple of quid more, but what an improvement (IMHO); I'm a s/w engineer and spend too much time on the keyboard, so getting it right is important to me.\nSo, I'd strongly recommend getting this Dell instead:- Dell P/Ns : 7D0KG , HWRD1 , WNK95 , C643N , DJ491"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This was my first keyboard so bear in mind I don't have much comparitive justification for a 5-star however I can say that it is a decent size (about 17 x 5.5 inches) and the keys feel responsive on press.\nI bought this to connect to my PS4 for easier typing. If anyone else is looking for a keyboard for the same purpose, I can tell you that this one works fine - just connect it to the USB slot and you're done.\nIf I had to change one thing about it, it would be to have heavier keys as they keys are quite light to press."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Was skeptical about buying this due to looking at a few of the negative reviews, specifically worrying about the \"clankiness\" the keys make, but for me it wasn't an issue in the end. Cheap, simple, well laid-out and works great."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Would come under the heading basic keyboard I guess that does everything you want a keyboard to do. It aint bulky which is a good thing but it aint obviously cheap either, has a decent weight to it compared to the cheaper alternatives but not heavy. keys are the big surprise they are just so nice to type on, something you might expect on a dearer model. I am well pleased with the design too. Really glad I bought this keyboard and at the price I urge anyone who is not a keyboard snob to do the same, you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"My preferred keyboard. It's got a great build quality which produces a nice sturdy keyboard which is great to use for whatever purpose. I like to avoid keyboards which feels too plasticy and this one does the job better than any other.
