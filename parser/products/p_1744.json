Unfortunately I had to return my first laptop as after about a month, it started randomly freezing.

The hard drive is too small, so as soon as there is an update - the hard drive is not large enough to cope (even if you delete everything you possibly can). What is worse is you cannot use a USB drive to resolve the issue.  Whilst they seem a great buy (and work perfectly until there is a Windows update) ... they are impossible to keep updated (and therefore secure etc). IMO these items are not fit for purpose.  I will happily correct this if HP can explain how it's done (something I've not found from hours of googling, various attempts etc)"},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Do not buy this laptop.\nI do not have anything downloaded.\nNot even attempted to watch youtube on it.\nI have only used publisher or word to write timesheets.\nThis laptop is sooooo slow.\nIt takes ages loading.\nYou havto click on things multiple times b4 it starts loading.\nJust clicking on print takes 10 seconds to load up.\nI could understand if i had been on loads of websites or downloaded loads.

I would very much like a refund on this product."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"This laptop or as I was told by the Technician today, it's a tablet with external keyboard; cannot handle basic updates from Windows 10, it is always out of space and I have no personal file stored.

Today i tried to upgrade the hard drive and was told it's impossible to upgrade :( this is not even worth making! And hp should be ashamed of this Neolithic machine!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"It does the job, I did have to buy an external hard drive & mouse, but for the price I can’t complain. I actually brought it because I saw one of the cool kids at university had one & being in my 40’s I don’t really have much of a clue when it comes to tech. I must say that cool kid just got a lot cooler cos if he’s actually completing his Uni work on this thing...well...I’m in ore, although it’s a nice little machine, don’t expect big things from it. Ideal for light use, maybe school homework, but that’s about it really."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Awful. Windows 10 tech that doesn't have the memory to run Windows 10 updates!"},{"rating":"2.0","content":"Do not buy this for gaming!!!\nDo not buy this for school or uni!!!\nI use my laptop for video calling, occasional internet search and more recently i needed office. For what i need, it just about handles. Its slow and when clicking between windows can lag. After intial set up there was 9gb space left. I bought an sd card and changed settings to move everything possible to that to free up some memory. A month later having only installed a printer, security and a video call app i keep getting alerts that theres only 3gb memory left.\nMy advice would be to google as soon as its set up and find out which of the hp crap you can delete safely because theres so much uneeded rubbish. And some that you cant delete.\nUltimately its the 2gb ram thats the issue. 4gb + is what you need for everyday use\nLaptops are like cars, you get what you pay for. I didnt pay much and i certainly didnt get much."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Headline says it all really. In ten years, this is the worst, most diabolical laptop I've ever had. I purchased it, quite naively, in the hopes of running Office, Photoshop, and for general internet usage. The first one that arrived worked fine for a few days, then kept going entirely black, crashing, shutting down, and all manner of inconvenient hiccups. Plus, to add insult to injury, despite being advertised as a 32GB laptop, it came with a few MB, not enough space to do ANYTHING.\nI spoke to HP support, who told me all was well (it was not) and that it was only intended for internet usage\n(which my current one struggles with.) I spoke to Amazon support, who rightly identified an issue with the display driver and sent me a replacement. As of now, 6 months into the replacement, I'm still having issues with crashing, screen going black etc. so the display driver seems to be an issue with every laptop of this model. It not only crashes on Office, when using Mail, and when browsing the internet (the purpose I was told it was built for) but the storage space is so small that I can't store any files on the actual laptop.\nI'd say it's best suited for beginners, and for people who hardly use it, but if you want a regular, reliable laptop, I'd pick a different model. Having had two of this exact laptop, I can firmly say it'll cause you problems even on basic things like Facebook and online shopping."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"There is not enough memory to update Windows 10 so is rendered useless.

I thought I would buy my kids their first.\nTo be honest I'm quite disappointed. HP shouldn't be doing a product that is THAT slow in 2018. It's annoying. Most of all, both HP and Amazon should warn buyers that over 25GB, out of a total 30GB, are taken by the default Windows 10 system. That leaves you with less than 5GB storage.\nAfter a normal 3 months use and storage of a few photos and videos, it is almost full. Windows will permanently ask you to erase files, in order to be able to update its system.\nThe rest is OK (design, weight, hardware, ecc)."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Dunno why people are moaning about this product!

Bought for my grandma who uses it once per month to do staffing for her job, the most basic of tasks. When it arrived we instantly noticed it was running rather slow but thought after some time it would improve, and since it would be used only for the most basic of tasks, it shouldn’t have been a problem. She’s used it less than ten times and now it is literall unusable. It freezes up and does not let you open any programs or apps. Says update required, but doesn’t have enough memory even to update, bearing in mind there has been nothing installed, downloaded or saved onto the hard drive! Literally a complete waste of money.

Yes HP does not provide downgrade rights so you will not get official driver support. You have to get hold of a wireless dongle and download a third party driver checker.\nVery nice design no over heating, operates quietly.\nIf you're going to be doing any work you're going to need external storage but that isn't a problem and don't expect to play DVDs on here without any external media either."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Love my laptop it's perfect for someone that studies that what I use mine for mostly.
