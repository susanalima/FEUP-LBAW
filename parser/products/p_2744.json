It's comfortable enough but not great and if you have lotscof mouse work to do I would rrcommend a better one.\nBut it's cheap and does the job so if that's what you need then it has all the functions; two buttons and a scroller and it's quite smooth and responsive."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Hardly fit for purpose.  I've had a cheap Mouse Pointer for about five years and only now is it starting to give problems.
