Although the buttons are small, my sausage fingers work them absolutely fine.  I use it for my Amazon Fire TV box, and it is flawless.  Easily paired, everything seems to work as it should. I particularly like the trackpad (square bit in the middle) it's like having the mouse function on your laptop.  Backlit keys are great in the evening with the lights down, and it actually feels like it is a quality make.\nRechargeable - I've had it well over a month and used it a lot, but even so it's still on it's first charge and no sign of loss of power.\nMy one tiny criticism is the blue \"on\" light, it is crazy bright!  I have a thing about extra bright LEDs, they have their place, but they don't belong on your bedside table (chargers) or remote controls when all you can see out of the corner of your eye is some evil elf with a laser pointer!!\nDon't let me put you off, this very minor irritation is easily fixed with tape/marker pen/paint... you get the idea.\nAnyway, if you are looking for one of these, this brand has my thumbs up."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Tried and tried to connect to Firestick, but nothing. Tried other devices with no issue. Finally put the unit right by the firestick and boom, it connected. Got 2ft away and it disconnected as soon as I hit a button!\nSo, unless you want to sit behind your TV to use this thing, forget it! I’m going to try a replacement and if it works, I’ll update this review.\nUpdate. Since the remote can’t connect to Firestick, when it’s pluged in behind the TV, I tried an HDMI extension lead, to bring it in front. It paired easily, but get outside of five foot away and it fails. No good for me, so have given up and returned the remote."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Dont buy this Bluetooth version if you want it to work with Android TV devices (STB \\ Projector \\ TV Sticks) it does not work it gets detected and pairs via Bluetooth but the keyboard can not be used at all in the android units. Some evidence suggest it may be TV box's built with Amlogic boards ,,, but I cant really confirm because I cant  get the f***** keyboard working."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I have mixed views on this. I have had the non Bluetooth wireless version for a couple of years and use it with our Qnap NAS. I leave the dongle in a spare USB socket and when I turn the keyboard on it is available immediately. The build quality is good and the battery seems to last forever with occasional use. In short, I really like it. It has all the keys I need and it is well thought out imo.\nI have just bought this Bluetooth version to use with my new Lenovo tablet (Tab 4 8 Plus). I needed the BT version as the old wireless dongle would not work using a OTG USB socket.\nFirst impressions were that the box had a sticker that looked authentic. Secondly, it has the old fashioned larger USB socket so it may be an old design. I looked at it very closely and it looks genuine to me.\nI switched on BT on the tablet and the pairing key on the keyboard and they paired quickly. A message popped up and disappeared before I had the chance to read it properly. After subsequently hunting through the Android settings I think it was asking whether I wanted to have the old virtual keyboard up on screen at the same time when using this physical keyboard. I said no as one of the reasons to use an external keyboard sometimes is that the virtual one obscures parts of the screen that I need to see.\nOverall it works ok. I am typing this review on it and using two fingers it is at least as fast as the virtual keyboard and maybe a bit faster. There are also times when typing on your lap is easier than reaching over and typing on the screen. I usually use the SwiftKey keyboard which is so good that I thought I would miss it's excellent predictive word functionality but I don't really. It is a bit early to say how it could be better but it seems to use the same spell check/autocorrect system as Swiftkey so there are not many errors when typing. It does not autocapitalise at the beginning of each sentence which is irritating and probably other minor defects will show up. There may be a way to fix some of these, as I say it is too early to say.\nHowever all is not sweetness & light and there are bigger problems. The main one appears very serious imo. When I ordered the keyboard I made sure it had a UK layout and you can see clearly in the pictures that it does. The problem is that the keyboard still has US mapping so that the keys ignore what is printed on them and do their own thing ;)  I should say again that I am using it on an Android tablet and it may be that it will be mapped correctly on other devices/platforms but personally I doubt it. I could live with the old @\" swopped keys chestnut as you get used to it but what makes it not acceptable to me is that there is no way I have found to type the GB pound symbol. I will not be able to live with this but it may be possible to get an android app to change the mapping. If there is I will come back and edit this review - if is still like this then I have been unsuccessful so Caveat Emptor.\nEDIT: Some good news. Today a much more expensive Logitech tablet keyboard arrived and it also has a UK layout of keys. After pairing it with the tablet I got the exact same behaviour of the keys being mapped incorrectly. I went on thr Logitech support site and downloaded an app which fixed regional keyboard issues. All I had to do was to tell it I was using a UK keyboard and all the keys started working properly. I am not sure if the app remapped them or maybe there was a simple setting in the Android settings that I should have changed. The good news is that it is not an issue with the Rii i8 and it can be fixed. So dont let it put you off buying it - you might have to fiddle around a bit but it will not be hard. Maybe just in settings or maybe download an app.\nThe other problem I have found sounds like a minor niggle but is serious imo. This is that there is no indicator light that shows you have the Caps Lock key pressed. The problem with this is that you can press it and then easily forget to switch it off and because you are looking at the keyboard to type and not the screen, when you do look up you can find you have typed a sentence or sometimes more, all in capital letters. You then have to delete it all and type it again - grrr ! I find this a surprising omission considering how so many things are well thought out eg left/right mouse clicks etc and they have packed so much functionality into such a small space. It is a real shame because I can't see any possibility that it can be fixed. I am going to email Riitek and tell them about this and a couple of other ideas I have and suggest they could give me a replacement keyboard if they change it :)\nEDIT: Just to say that the Logitech keyboard which costs 4 x the Rii also does not have a Caps lock light :(\nSo, to sum up - it is cute little thing that could be useful but has a small flaw."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I bought the Rii8 bluetooth version and wish I had bought the dongle only version instead.  I like the keyboard but there are issues with this bluetooth version and the raspberry pi.\nI wanted to use this to connect with Raspberry Pi's both in headed and headless configuration.  I am experienced with Linux and very able to learn and follow instructions.  However, I could not get this to work at all on any Debian distro (inc Raspbian Stretch).  The unit will pair but does not work as a HID - at least on Stretch at the time of writing.\nI can not blame Rii soley.  Having researched it seems many people have no issue on the Pi but many others do.  The dongle only version seems to be a lot more reliable and less fuss than the Bluetooth version.\nTo be fair, I must  say that it would connect with Windows without any issue and performed very well in this application.  The actual keyboard is well made, easy to use and very good value.  I am certain it would make a great media center input device.\nThe keys are soft and rubberised (reminds me of a ZX80!) and the backlighting works very well.  All characters are available - I like coding and would certainly use the Rii to do small edits in code but I would not want to write an application from scratch with it.\nThe device is meant to connect via Bluetooth OR via the included USB dongle.  I have read the instructions but am still a bit uncertain of why the dongle is included.\nRii have obviously spent time and effort making a useful and neat little keyboard, my only complaint is the issues with the Rpi."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Just got my bluetooth Rii today and at first i wasnt sure if i was happy. The keys werent typing what they should ect. I sussed out what that was all about.  This keyboard does indeed type what it says on the keys. Its a UK keyboard. So the problem is the apps were using are USA ect based so not quite synced with our uk keyboard. So we want to type @ for instance and it shows something else. To get @ you need to shift and 2 i think.  So its not the keyboard, its the apps. The reason i know this is i paired it to my laptop on windows 10 with bluetooth and tested it in Google and all the symbols typed what they say on the key.  £ and @ is on the right key.  Everythings just like it is on a normal uk laptop.  It works fine with Firestick 4K, you get used to where the alternative keys are. But for just searching and controlling the apps its fine. Keep the remote handy to swap with now and again for certain buttons in certain apps but they are few. If you think your touchpad isnt working on an app keep in mind its easy to switch the touchbar off by accident when you fiddle with the buttons.  Fn along with F6 or F8 switches the touchpad back on again,  or just swith the keyboard off and on again.\nI noticed a lot of people are saying their touchpad isnt very responsive and the arrow or cursor is slow. Well thats easy fixed as well, iv got a great tip for that.  Hold down Fn and the spacebar and it cycles through the touchpad speeds, its slow by default. Each time you press Fn and spacebar it gets faster. It goes to about level 3 or 4  then it goes back onto slow again. Just do that and keep trying the speed each time till its fast enough. I just use the page up n down at the right hand side or the top right pad for scrolling.  If you speed the cursor or pointer up the 2 finger scrolling is too fast but id rather have a faster pointer speed to get about the screen.  Also you get a bluetooth dongle with it as my laptop doesnt have bluetooth and once i plugged it in it was instantly bluetooth enabled and found my mini keyboard and paired with it. A bluetooth dongle alone would cost upwards of £6 and you get one with this.\nThis is a great little keyboard and im very happy with it now iv sussed out what its about. Its very good quality and i dont know why all the negative reviews,  some people are either unlucky or they arent very tech savvy ect  but also there are a lot of fake reviews on Amazon and its been well documented so i wouldnt trust all i read."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I'm not happy with the remote, it lags worse than the shield tv remote, it shuts off and stops responding when using it making me have to turn it on and off again, and there is no voice search feature even though it has a mic built into the remote it doesn't work with the shield tv.\nTouchpad works OK but it's a little oversensitive, keyboard works fine, button shortcuts work fine but the other problems let it down a lot.\njust a update, it seems you have to get closer to the device for it to function properly, so if i want to use it i have to sit a bit forward to respond without lagging which is awkward for me.\njust a update 29/04/2018 the touchpad has seemed to stopped working everything else still works though but i'm not happy about it, didn't even have it for at least a year before the touchpad crapped out, i'm going to browse around and look for something else i don't think i would purchase this again."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"1) backlight does not work on the upper part near trackpad\n2) trackpad stops working for no reason although all keys are fine (this is not the turn off trackpad option its real)\n3) battery needs charging indicator does not work meaning you complete flatten battery\n4) battery last two days as apposed to weeks in my last version\non the upside it took alot of effort to smash it to bits in a rage\ni will beware of this seller now\nthe original seller  Gemgojustnow  has dissapeared from this product after i posted this review - WEIRD coincidence\nnow this item is listed byt a seller called \"S Sam\" guessing he rotates names but who knows"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Using in amazon fire stick for sideloaded apps that are designed for touch screens so the touchpad is needed. Was initially worried when found the bluetooth receiver located in the rear of the unit as the instructions also say requires a spare usb port. Needent have worried however as bluetooth pairing worked first time. Keys are soft and not clunky though on two android devices the @ and \" are not working despite the settings being UK and the £ comes out as #. Fire stick seems to need a hard tap on trackpad but there are other buttons for left and right mouse click anyway. Very light weight which is a plus."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Pity that this unit is charged by an OTG cable and not micro USB. Maybe the newer version will be micro USB so I suggest waiting until the new version becomes available. The bluetooth connection is easy to connect and works ok (not as good as the dedicated receiver and non-bluetooth version Rii X8 with red scroll where which I bought on my travels) The unit includes a mini bluetooth dongle which is stored in a tidy pocket within the back of the unit if not required. I suggest sacrifice one of your precious Android usb ports and use the dedicated non bt dongle. Brilliant keyboard with excellent battery life and when it begins running low just pop it on a micro usb for twenty mins and your cable free for another week.\nHope this is of help."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"Nice keyboard but disappointingly it does not work with an H96+ TV box - not even with the dongle that was included with the keyboard.  I can pair the TV box with it but there is no response when I do anything on the keyboard.  Strangely other bluetooth keyboards work with my H96+ TV box and this keyboard works with my iPhone but the keyboard and TV box must have some compatibility issues.  I did read online that upgrading to Android 7.1 fixes the problem however unfortunately this is not the case.  Even after upgrading my TV box to the latest software the compatibility problem is still there.  Returned for a refund."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"A lovely little device.\nWhen using my laptop as a media center connected to a tv in my house or in a hotel room, this little keypad is idea to use it from accros the room.\nAllows full control over typing, bowsing, and playback functions.\nEven has back lit keys for when used in a dark room.\nPlus, the touch pad actually works well. I find it best to lower mouse speed in windows first though, and then it works well. Even has multi touch gestures for scrolling.\nYou certaily wouldn't want to type a novel on this, but for light use, such as instant messaging, or emails, this is perfect.\nRuberised as well, so feels really nice."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Arrived to day so not a long testing period, but so far really good, it connected first time to 3 items a Fire Stick, Tablet and PC, so that was good. A useful tip that wasn't in the enclosed manual but was on the web version is to use the Fn + BACK key combo to delete, as at first this seemed faulty. Knowing this may help someone else. It was a lot smaller than anticipated but then I should have read the dimensions more carefully, but this is not a problem and will most likely prove a boon."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Wow, what a great little device this is! Works out of the box, and connected to my Android phone in seconds! The touchpad works well, and the build quality is excellent. As an added bonus, the keyboard has a storage compartment for a USB nano bluetooth receiver- complete with the receiver itself (thats £5 on its own!). This will hopefully work with the early Raspberry Pi that i intend to use this keyboard for. I may also get another one to work with an old android tablet where the touch screen is no longer working."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Photo taken with keyboard lights on, although conditions where bright. Arrived on time,  took less than 5 minutes to set up & its  already up and running and being used to type this, light, comfortable, works as epected om my fire tablet 7\" 7th gen, although some keys are transposed. The same as others have pointed out @ # and the Pound sign ive not discovered yet even though its marked on the keyboard. The @ and the \" buttons are found by swapping the fucntios and presssing shift. IE \" is the @ symbol position on the keyboard markins and vica versa. im sure i'll find the pound symbol eventually or perhaps i may have to alter some stting on the firetab as others have remarked upon in other reviews. i will update the information here when i have properly worked it out later. But on the whole a good and pleasing very functional purchase so far. i have yet to try it on my firestick, mobile, laptop or use the media fucntions so standby for further updates."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I got this for operating the media PC I have hooked up to the TV. It's certainly more sofa-friendly than a full-size keyboard. Decent battery life, keys are nice and tactile.\nOn the down side, the trackpad was jerky and difficult to use, particularly the scroll function was very inconsistent. It could take quite a long time to reconnect from idle. Also, USB mini? who uses USB mini any more?\nIn the end, though, it was a decent enough device, until just recently it stopped working; spamming keypresses at the computer then disconnecting. You get what you pay for, I guess."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is the third Rii keyboard i have bought. The first two i have been using everyday for years and they are still working perfect.\nI just bought this Rii i8 Bluetooth and its just as awesome. It's quality built and great.

My only gripe so far is that the manual is not very clear on the method for pairing but only I found the bluetooth pairing button I was able to par it to my raspberry pi 3 with no problem so 1 star lost for that.

Perfectly small [in same scale of a TV remote ] with a nice lay out . It’s a fully functional media keyboard with great short cut buttons [volume, browser, search, mute, skip etc etc]. Touch pad is great, and the back lit keys are an essential feature [that the older models do not have].\nSo why the 3 stars? Well, the included Bluetooth dongle did not work with windows 10. System would not detect it correctly [Error ‘Device Descriptor Request Failed’ in device manager. I could not find drivers for the thing anywhere].
