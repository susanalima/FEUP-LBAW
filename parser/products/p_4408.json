This case has tons of space and was a joy to build in."},{"q":"Can i fit an ssd inside a slot without having to buy a bracket or extra parts???","a":"Yes."},{"q":"Are the fans pre-installed or can you fit your own?","a":"The fans are pre-installed but there is no reason why you can’t change them for something more suited to your build"},{"q":"Do the front 2 fans bring in enough sufficient airflow ?","a":"yes they do, plus I have added an additional fan to the top of the case, just a shame it didn't come with that already installed."},{"q":"Does this have an anti-dust filter?","a":"yesh 3 one on top and one on bottom and front case"},{"q":"is there space for water cooling?","a":"easyly space for water colling"},{"q":"can it handle fortnite?","a":"This is just the PC case, but it has good cooling and it fits a bunch of different sized motherboards, stuff like the cpu, gpu, and RAM are really what decide on if the pc can run fortenite.

After opening it all up I was greeted with professional quality design and feeling parts and case. There was plastic protecting shiny facia and window panel.

I installed an Asus RoG Strix B350-F motherboard with an AMD Ryzen 5 2600X and 16gb Corsair vengeance 2666MHz DDR4 RAM into the case. It comes with 6 motherboard standoffs already installed so you have to install another 3 if you have an ATX motherboard. I found that it was impossible to get the motherboard to line up perfectly with all of the standoffs so I ended up leaving 3 or 4 of the screws out. Even without all of the screws in, the motherboard was stuck down nice and sturdy so I don't consider this too much of a flaw. Cable management was a dream. I pulled all of the PSU and case cables out behind the motherboard tray so that they're all out of the central chamber of the case and not restricting airflow. Routing cables from behind the motherboard tray to each of the components was painless as there's plenty of cutouts around the inside of the case. I noticed that there's dust filters for almost everything on this case. The only fan that doesn't have a dust filter is the exhaust fan but why would you want to trap dust inside your PC? Once I'd plugged everything in, the fans lit up and started spinning. Surprisingly, the three included case fans are really quiet!\nTo summarise, I'd give this case a 10/10 for the price. It looks great, airflow seems good despite the fans being really quiet, installing components and managing cables is really easy and it has dust filters everywhere. I'm now considering buying this case for my own PC instead of the coolermaster H500M which is a £200 case. It has a similar design for a quarter of the price. Of course, the CPU and GPU temperatures that this case can achieve will never compete with the coolermaster H500M but it's about a quarter of the price so I'm definitely tempted. I'd recommend this case to anyone who's not wanting to break the bank for a case but wants something functional, easy to install into, dust resistant and stylish."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I've had a few high end, expensive cases in my time and also some seriously cheap cases for budget builds.\nFor the money I am actually really impressed with this case, I'm building a gaming machine for a 7 year old boy and this has all the good stuff like a side-window, LED fans, USB 2 & 3 etc on the front panel, hidden power supply and decent cable management - he's going to love it!\nThe only thing I don't really like about this case is that to open the case up you have to remove 5 or 6 thumb screws, but I'm not going to complain too much about that.\nOverall very happy, will attach photos when the build is finished."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"The case feels solid on the outside but a little bendy on the inside, strengthens up when you add components.
