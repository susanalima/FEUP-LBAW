{"name":"Asus Chromebit CS10 Rockchip 3288-C, 2 GB RAM, 16 GB eMMC, Chrome OS - Black","brand":"ASUS","weight":"381 g","model":"CHROMEBIT-B004C","color":"Black","cpu_brand":"Rockchip","cpu_count":"4","ram":"2 GB","hdd_size":"16 GB","hdd_tech":"emmc","os":"Chrome OS","release_date":"26 Nov. 2015","price":"£103.63","stock":256,"q_a":[{"q":"Isn't a google Chromecast a better option?","a":"Chromecasts stream content and are not computers in themselves.  This is a self contained computer.  Chromecasts are ideal for attaching to televisions, Chromebits less so as you use it as a computer and need to sit closer to the display and interact using a keyboard and mouse. Two different beasts really."},{"q":"Does the Chromebit have any USB ports? I know it's all hooked up the Cloud, but sometimes it's useful to be able to open from or save to a USB stick.","a":"There is one USB port on the Chromebit. This can be expanded using a USB hub, though I would recommend a powered hub if you plan to connect several devices."},{"q":"Does it run android if set in developer mode?","a":"NO"},{"q":"I forgot to ask: Are there any security issues with the Chromebit and can you reset it if you get a virus attack?","a":"The Chrome OS is very secure by its nature. It is essentially linux. Also, if you ever need to fully reset the OS, you will find \"power wash\"  option in settings, which returns chromebit to factory state."},{"q":"Will this run chrome remote desktop so i can access my remote imac computer?","a":"Yes, no problem. The remote desktop app is already installed in the Chrome browser on the Chromebit."},{"q":"Is this capable of running sketchup via google?","a":"Well support for android and therefore SketchUp viewer was supposed to come to Chromebit in 2017. Suspect not there yet. But could be in developer channel. Have u tried online SketchUp?"},{"q":"Can proxy settings be added to the chromebit so it can be used in a school environment?","a":"Please refer to Asus help @ https://www.asus.com/au/support/faq/1018761/"},{"q":"Will it work if i get a hdmi to usb for it","a":"No. HDMI has a faster data transfer speed rate. The information can't go through usb quick enough."},{"q":"Can you watch sky go on this device?","a":"No!"},{"q":"Can you link more than one bluetooth devuce at once for example keyboard ans speakers?","a":"Yes, I have keyboard, mouse and Bluetooth headphones connected"},{"q":"Can you download movies through Google Movies as you can on Chromebooks?","a":""},{"q":"When will this be available to but in the UK?","a":"Yes"},{"q":"Would it work with an hdmi to ypbpr converter on an older tv?","a":"Although you can buy convertors which will convert the video signal the HDMI interface definition is a lot more complex and the chances it will function correctly are minimal."},{"q":"Can it play flash video?","a":"Yes"},{"q":"does it have expandable memory, could i put a sd in it?","a":"No it doesn't have expandable memory or an sd slot. I've  bought a USB hub that sits directly in the one USB slot it has on the end, which allows me to plug in a USB stick for extra memory, and a mouse and keyboard etc."},{"q":"Is it possible to connect the chromebit to the internet via its usb port instead of by wifi?","a":"Yes, if you connect a USB Ethernet adapter. I would recommend finding a USB hub with built-in Ethernet, although some require more power via the USB link than the Chromebit can supply, so choose carefully!"},{"q":"Where can you purchase the power cable if you need another?","a":"I would assume Asus"},{"q":"How do you get sound off this? Do you need to buy speakers?","a":"I plugged it into the TV and used the TV speakers"},{"q":"Hi - can it be powered from the USB port on the monitor?","a":"No. There's a separate power supply. You should still buy one. They're brilliant."},{"q":"Can you install sky go on it?","a":"SKY GO requires the use of microsoft Silverlight which is not compatible with chromeos. When your chromebit is updated to run Android apps then it should be possible to run the Android app for SKY GO but until then it is not possible."},{"q":"Does anyone know the voltage and power adapter type for the chromebit? i want to see if it can be usb powered","a":"Sadly, the Chromebit CS10 can only be powered from its own proprietary mains adapter. Oh, for a 2019 Chromebit with USB-C..."},{"q":"Do all playstore games play on this device?","a":"The Chromebit doesn’t have Android support and as a nearly four-year-old device, I think it’s highly unlikely that it ever will, so the Play Store is sadly not an option here."},{"q":"I hear some chrome os devices support android apps. does this?","a":"The CS10 is on the list for Android apps but it has not been implemented at the current time."},{"q":"I've bought 7 CS10s off amazon.com, and they came with us chargers. where can i buy uk chargers?","a":"You could try a multi voltage universal power supply. They're widely available and have several different fittings. The power supply that came with my Chromebit states the output is 12v and 1.5A."},{"q":"Has anyone had any success using this with Couchtuner, live football streams that can be found on google?","a":"I've never used couchtuner but I know chromebit works perfectly"},{"q":"Do the Bluetooth keyboard and mouse have to state that they go with Chromebit, or what is best to buy?","a":"There's no need. Any BT keyboard and mouse would work."},{"q":"Does it have the normal chrome browser and able to install the usual add-ons, like Super Auto Refresh?","a":"It uses the Chrome browser so extensions including Super Auto Refresh is available."},{"q":"Does it come with UK plug powersupply","a":"Yes it does have a UK power supply."},{"q":"Can a vpn be installed on this?","a":"Yes, you can. The Chromebit runs Chrome OS the same way a Chromebook does. Check this https://www.androidcentral.com/how-setup-vpn-chromebook"},{"q":"How many users can you have on this device?","a":"Only one at any one time. It does not have its own logon, though  you will likely want to log onto your Google account. It does not make you re-logon between uses, so its not like Windows in the regard."}],"reviews":[{"rating":"4.0","content":"I bought this device as I was sick of the fan noise and ever increasing start up time of my 1 year old windows 10 PC.\nCurrently I am studying for upcoming exams and I use two chrome tabs simultaneously (one for research and the other for google docs to type up study notes).

This was going to be a stop gap solution for my citrix remote access into work, but it's handily replaced the need to buy a PC or another laptop.
