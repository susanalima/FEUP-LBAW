The Asus would start up in 24 seconds.  This Dell starts up in approx. 50 seconds.  So I've learnt to switch it on, put the kettle on and then come back.  That aside, I can see that the Dell generally runs a little faster than my previous laptop.  And I do like the feel of the keyboard on this one (I do a lot of report writing) so that's a bonus."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Well worth the money. I researched for ages and took lots of advice from people more in the know than me and this was the recommended item. Price was a major factor and I couldn’t be more happy with my new laptop. The battery is great but it should be its new ha ha but it is really comfortable to use especially over long periods of time. It’s slim and looks great but most importantly it was easy to use and set up and I’m really happy with it. Knew Dell was a decent make anyway but this is perfect. I use mine mostly for editing photographs and writing documents and it’s just perfect, dare I say. Know nothing about the proper technicalities involved but I’m mega happy with it and would recommend."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"We purchased this laptop for our child to do basic secondary school homework on, and not for gaming or streaming, so i3 and 4GB memory would seem adequate.  It has been an embarrassing choice for me, the windows 8 operating system it came with isn't intuitive, it is really slow to get started, every time you restart it you have to wait 20 minutes for it to load new software, it came with a load of anti-virus stuff that slows it down and constantly tries to sell you stuff - upgrades etc.  I am now trying to buy extra memory to get it to work at all - you have to completely take the unit apart to get to the memory slot, unlike other, older lap-tops I use.\nIt crashes most days it is used, losing work.  Amazon and Dell should have done their work to avoid specifying this combination of software and hardware which performs so badly under basic use.  I have used Dell laptops over many years for work, this will be the last one purchased by me."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"what an absolute belony to write a poor or bad review about this DELL inspiration 15-3000\nFor any computer you have to install the basics... when you install further software, always additional updates\nEven for a smartphone you have to install/update/register more than for this laptop.\nThis is a quick and easy to install machine. Even a reboot is quick.  Do not write reviews when you are used to APPLE products, since you cant start an Apple without an account, without credit card details whatsoever.  THIS IS A WINDOWS COMPUTER.  No problem working with 3rd party software interlinking with WORD/EXCEL/ACCESS OR POWERPOINT.  The only thing I am struggling with is the UK keyboard, since I used to and want to work with US keyboard.  AMAZON, please add the option to choose the keyboard since that is the only ISSUE anyone can have,\nthanks for reading"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I read some of the other reviews and was a bit sceptical about buying this, but so far so good a nice laptop for the price. as per other reviews be patient setting up it takes a while due to upgrades."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Slow in booting up - frustrating purchase.

Right away at the moment I figured that I've made the worst decision ever. I fixed cause I needed my laptop to work with and since then I still thinking if I'm the only who's going to pay for it. Completely disappointed. If someone ask about buy products on Amazon, I might say might be a mistake.\nAlso runs on low speed.\nJust because I bought a laptop doesn't make me rich, it means that I've worked a lot to have something that supposed to be a tool to improve and upgrade my life."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"I am sorry to say this,  but this laptop takes 51 seconds to open from entering my password, at that point the screen goes blank for around another15 seconds.

I will remove what I have put on and see if it  improves, if not I will return it on Monday. It is now Thursday, I have removed AVG and now this laptop takes over 3 minutes to open after entering my password, I am sending it back to Amazon"},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Worst laptop I’ve ever bought.

From initially turning it on you might as well book the day off work as this is no quick setup, after entering my details and waiting for something to happen I knew straight away this was going to be a slow machine.\nYou will also enjoy the On game with this machine, lift the lid is it on or off, sit and wait, press the power button, oops it was on it just flashed up but now I've put it in standby, shut the lid, wait, lift the lid... given up now, held the power button down, no consistency sadly.\nSadly I have missed the return date to send it back, 30 days !! 30 days to use it and see if its going to last, unfortunately my idea of buying a ssd drive to try and speed the thing up has been rumbled by constantly unplugging the charger to take to it work to find an error message saying incompatible charger, its become a morning tradition with the family now, the kids love telling me daddy your laptop hasn't charged again and the excitement when it has is breath taking.\nWhat else can I say, I'm not normally negative and don't like leaving bad reviews but seriously Dell, pull your badge off this one, your tech in this price barrier is worlds apart from other brands"},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Incredibly slow trying to set up forced to open a Microsoft account but then just got black screen and would not go any further couldn't even reset it back to start before sending back.

The screen clarity is decent enough when viewing media and power consumption is not hugely taxing, roughly 5hrs of life before needing to be charged.\nAlthough It is quoted as a windows 10 computer, this is the trial version windows 10 still has to be bought so add €145 onto the inital price. Also the long boot time approx. 50s is a bit annoying."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Sorry, but I've seen toasters faster than this laptop!! Any medium-budget laptop with 10 years old is faster than this one.\nIt takes ages to start, ages to open any program, ages to perform user actions... It freezes so much that, sometimes, I think the system had crashed or so... but after 20 or 30 seconds, it just wakes up and do some stuff. If you just need access to mails and basic things, for this price, buy a very decent mobile. If it's not the case, consider investing a bit more money and buy a better laptop. In both cases, my advice is not to but this product."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"The laptop arrived, turned it on and it then took 3 days to update to the latest Windows 10.

It was the performance which left me angry. My old laptop is 10 years old ( emachines E525 )and it is better in every way. Had this Dell laptop 2 weeks before returning it as it was just so slow! Every time I used it, it was slower than the time before. Total waste of my time and money. Going to spend more on a Core i5 and hope its worth it."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I bought this as a standby for my aging, excellent Apple and to give me experience of Windows.
