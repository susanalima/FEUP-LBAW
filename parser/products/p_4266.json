And I'm always on the hunt for  the best mouse in the world!\nAvailable in three colours, Black/Gold, White, and the one I went for, Midnight Teal. This mouse has a total of seven buttons, all of which are programmable by downloading the Logitech software. The software is called Logitech Options and is available from their website. In the software, as well as programming buttons, you can change the pointer speed. And that's about it.\nThis isn't a gaming mouse though, so of course there's no lights on it to change the colour of etc and the DPI of the pointer is only 200 – 4000 and these can only be set in an increment of 50.\nThat's ok though for most professional users. But it doesn't give you any info of what setting this is currently set to, it just has a slider. That's it.\nProgramming buttons was as easy as it should be. For each button you get a selection of functions that you can select from, or you can create a macro. This was easy enough to do.\nThe mouse has two ways to connect to your PC. It comes with a USB wireless receiver, and it also has Bluetooth built in. But you should know that your PC must have 'Bluetooth Low Energy Technology' for it to work. My PC doesn't but my laptop does, therefore my PC has the USB receiver plugged in and my laptop just connects via Bluetooth. Both work very well I might add. The mouse connects first time EVERY time with no delays. You can also pair this mouse with up to three devices. There is a button at the bottom you can press to toggle through the three device profiles when needed, more on this later. They can even have different button layouts for each.\nThe thumb rest is also a button itself as with Logitech's other MX models. Pressing this will allow you to view all the apps you have running at the time. Very handy. But of course this can be reprogrammed too. The thumb area has a rubberised coating which feels quite nice on the thumb but I will say I preferred the Performance MX thumb grip to this one as it had more grip.\nThe rubberised area stops as it meets the back and top of this mouse. Here it turns to a plastic material which does have a slight mat coating which feels OK when the palm is resting on it and so far doesn't seem to make me sweat while using it, which is always a plus.\nThe far side where your pinky finger rests is also rubberised for comfort. This makes lifting the mouse all the much easier unlike their earlier G602 gaming mouse.\nThe thumb side of the mouse has a side scrolling wheel and two buttons. I must say the placement of these buttons could have been better thought out. They seem to have squashed them together. I think it would of worked better if there was just one button either side of the scroll wheel.\nI have reprogrammed these buttons to be cut and paste as I do a lot of file management on my computer systems so I use those functions all the time.\nThe side scrolling wheel is of a beautiful quality. I could scroll this wheel all day as I love the smoothness of it. Unfortunately that's where my love for this wheel dies a death. The rubberised grip on the wheel attracts dust and small debris. Once something is stuck inside the grip it is very hard to remove it. Also I don't really often have a reason to side scroll really. Seems a bit of a novelty. Unless you use spreadsheets a lot. There is good news though. You can reprogramme it. You don't have as many options with this though. For example you cant assign a macro to this wheel. But what I did was select the 'page back and forwards' option. This means when I scroll upwards it goes a page forwards and when I scroll downwards it goes backwards. This might seem a little weird at first but I got used to it surprisingly fast.\nThe main vertical scroll wheel has the 'free-wheel' function MX users will be used to. By default the button above the wheel engages and releases the gears of the wheel. This way if your looking through a long document or webpage, you can press this button to disengage the gears and the wheel will spin freely, allowing you to scroll down or up extremely fast. I personally decided to change this button to 'Save', and then enable the 'SmartShift' option in the software. This means that the gears will stay engaged on the wheel. But if I give the wheel a sharp spin it will sense this and automatically switch the wheel into free spin mode. It will then re-engage the gear after it stops. And this works really well! I love this feature. And you can even set the sensitivity of this.\nOK so the feature that really sold this mouse to me was the FLOW system. Enabling this in the software means you can drag the mouse pointer to the edge of the screen on you PC and then it will appear on the screen of your Laptop. It is quite handy if you often use your laptop on your PC desk at the same time while using your PC. This way you can use just one mouse for the two computers and amazingly you can even copy files from one to another. You press copy on your PC for example, then move your mouse to your laptop screen and click paste. Whallah! Unfortunately you can't drag and drop files but that's not a big problem.\nSo all in all this mouse is impressive in certain ways and a let down in others. I feel the mouse needs more buttons. One or two more on top like the G602, and one or two more OR just a reconfigure of button placement on the side. The thumb wheel, although a nice novelty, it needs to  have more programmable options to be useful.\nThe size and ergonomics of the mouse is good and I wouldn't say much improvement is needed there. But the feel of it could be nicer. The battery seems to be amazing. I've had it just over 2 months and I've only charged it once since it came out of the box. The battery indicator was on two lights when I opened it and it is was still on two lights after over 2 weeks usage. It boasts up to 70 days of use between charges and it seems to be telling the truth.\nWhat's great though is it's supplied with a USB cable which you can plug into the front of the mouse in order to charge it and keep on using it while you do. Brill!\nAnother quick mention too is the dark field laser technology which is superb. This mouse will work on even clear glass as long as it's a minimum of 4mm thick. And the range of this mouse is 10m.\nIf this was helpful please click the 'Yes' button below as then I'll know I helped someone :)"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I've waited a month before writing my review in order to get a proper use of the mouse.

It's beautifully designed (for right handed people!) and feels like a quality product.\nIt works with just about anything with bluetooth or using the provided USB dongle.\nThe wheels feel great, the buttons provide good feedback and it glides smoothly!

Big big big massive but... DO NOT BUY IF YOU USE THE MIDDLE MOUSE BUTTON!!!! Unless you are willing to remap the MmB function to spare button. I use 3D software and for me, not only was the MmB really hard to press down in order to register a clicking noise (which is also a rather loud clunck), the actual button doesn't appear to work that way intentionally. Looking on the forums this appears to be an common issue with no real way to resolve it.. massive shame.\nIf you are comfortable remapping again this isn't a huge issue.. but as someone who professionally uses mice between work and home, this wasn't an ideal solution for me.\nThe other hotkeys are great and can be reprogrammed with the swapping between desktops to be a really handy function! So the only gripe I truly have with this device and is the ultimate deal breaker for me is that middle mouse button (MmB) or technically lack of."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"EDIT: The White/Grey colour variant I bought has become very discoloured after extended use in a clean office environment (working as a Web Developer) so I have decided to return it to purchase the Black/Graphite variant.\nThe product is excellent.  One of the best-in-class mice for both work & gaming.  The white/grey colour scheme I chose fits in perfectly with my Surface Book 2 and was the reason I purchased it.  Aside from the 'toggleable' ratchet scrolling being quite loud which annoys my colleagues, I have no complaints about the mouse in of itself.\nThe bundled software (Logitech Options) is also pretty good, with a vast range of different options to customise your experience that increases its versatility for an array of users.  However, the update functionality baked into the programme is extremely aggressive.  I was in the 'zone' at work the other day and every few minutes, I had my train of thought broke by Logitech Options informing me of a software update.  It became so frequent and so distracting that I had no choice but to trigger the update and follow the installation wizard.\nOne notification per boot is perfectly adequate, Logitech.  Failing that, why not develop automatic update functionality for the programme if keeping it up-to-date is so critical to you?"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is the pinnacle of mouse.\nThe size is perfect, the tracking is phenomenal on ridiculous shiny surfaces, the buttons are useful, and it glides so smoothly I keep checking the underside for oil.\nI can't get over how good it is. Especially with Bluetooth, so there's no need for a dongle.\nI'm struggling to think of anything that Logitech could improve here. Maybe make the gesture button sensitive to directional swipes, instead of having to press it and move the mouse. Then it'd be six stars."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I searched the internet for desktop mouse reviews and found most cool devices were for gaming and the reviews were mostly aimed at that. Even looking at the Logitech MX Anywhere 2S the reviews had a hint at gaming and not so much for multitasking. I took the plunge and purchased this mouse as I needed a portable mouse for multitasking at home and on the go. It turned out that this was my best mouse purchase in more than a decade.\nThe multitasking feature \"Flow\" allows you to work with two or three computers by just dragging the mouse towards the edge of the screen only to end up on my laptop situated next to my desktop. Its amazing and I do not even need to flip the switch under the mouse to change my workstation. I would however need to flip that switch once I work with one computer only which is fine. Not only is this a great multitasking mouse it also has amazing battery life, even though I only tried it for a short period of time. The surface I use the mouse on is an old wooden table with a rugged surface and there is no issue with the connection and movement on the screen, flawless! The shape and buttons sit perfectly and I had no problem reaching everything. I do have large hands.\nIf you are looking for a multitasking mouse on the go, get this one!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is not a paid review by any stretch of the imagination. I know the site is infested with fake reviews but please don't dismiss this as one. If you have 2 computers, mac/pc pc/pc etc This thing will revolutionize your workflow.\nThis is one of the most amazing product I've ever bought. Their software they've called 'flow' literally blew my mind. Its brought so much synergy in my workflow between my MacBook Pro and PC you can't even imagine. You can effortlessly copy and paste things across 2 computers. You can use this mice between the two in such a seamless way you'd be shocked. This product has put Logitech in a new light for me. There is so much innovation in this.\nI am going to write a detailed review in the future after I've used it a while. The mouse itself also feels incredible, very solid build and works great on my wooden desk without a mat. Very comfortable too.\nI recommend you try it out, if you don't like it you can easily return it. I thought it would be gimmicky, Immediately retracted that thought after using it."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I have had few Logitech portable mice over the years that I use every day but this is the first one I've been disappointed by.\nMy primary issue is that it has an even smaller profile than previous models.  I have small hands and even for me it feels uncomfortable.\nSecondly, my instant reaction when I took out of the box was that it feels cheap. They've used plastic that tries to look like metal and even the wheel has that fake shiny chrome effect on it you get on really cheap plastic goods.  It has an obvious seam at the back and front and the non stick pads on the underneath look like they've got greasy scuff marks on them.  Even the new lowercase logo feels unoriginal and last decade. It all just seems a bit substandard for an expensive mouse.\nMy last gripe is that I was hoping it might be a bit quieter, not even louder than my existing mouse.\nIt's not a terrible mouse, but it feels like Logitech has lost its touch and it's time to look at other brands"},{"rating":"1.0","content":"I work in architecture and run my own studio, so a good mouse for CAD / BIM software is essential.  I've used a Magic Mouse for many years, but was looking for something maybe a bit better for my hand / wrist.\nThe scroll wheel on the Logitech MX Master 2S that I received was unbalanced.  I would push the scroll wheel forward, in order to zoom in / scroll. Most of the time, as soon as I took my finger (carefully) away, the wheel would roll back in the opposite direction, appearing to rebalance itself, and consequently undoing the zoom / scroll that I'd just done.\nIt should be noted that there is a way to set the wheel so it clicks as it moves, which I find quite noisy (I'm not used to it), and also tiring when working in CAD.  I prefer 'free wheeling', but the lack of balance made the mouse unusable for me.  I searched this specific term online, and there appears to be other people with a similar problem.\nAs a side note, I also found the button that is under the thumb rest pad very difficult to press, although I guess it has to be or you'd be accidentally pressing it all the time.  I noticed this very early on, when setting the mouse up, but that alone didn't deter me as I don't need loads of button commands.  But an unbalanced scroll wheel is a complete non-starter.\nIt's surprising because this mouse comes out at the top of many review lists for creative professionals (which is what sold it to me) and it's safe to say it is not the most economic in terms of cost!

It's getting sent back for a full refund."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"So I bought this because I'm a PC mouse enthusiast of sorts. And I'm always on the hunt for  the best mouse in the world!\nAvailable in three colours, Black/Gold, White, and the one I went for, Midnight Teal. This mouse has a total of seven buttons, all of which are programmable by downloading the Logitech software. The software is called Logitech Options and is available from their website. In the software, as well as programming buttons, you can change the pointer speed. And that's about it.\nThis isn't a gaming mouse though, so of course there's no lights on it to change the colour of etc and the DPI of the pointer is only 200 – 4000 and these can only be set in an increment of 50.\nThat's ok though for most professional users. But it doesn't give you any info of what setting this is currently set to, it just has a slider. That's it.\nProgramming buttons was as easy as it should be. For each button you get a selection of functions that you can select from, or you can create a macro. This was easy enough to do.\nThe mouse has two ways to connect to your PC. It comes with a USB wireless receiver, and it also has Bluetooth built in. But you should know that your PC must have 'Bluetooth Low Energy Technology' for it to work. My PC doesn't but my laptop does, therefore my PC has the USB receiver plugged in and my laptop just connects via Bluetooth. Both work very well I might add. The mouse connects first time EVERY time with no delays. You can also pair this mouse with up to three devices. There is a button at the bottom you can press to toggle through the three device profiles when needed, more on this later. They can even have different button layouts for each.\nThe thumb rest is also a button itself as with Logitech's other MX models. Pressing this will allow you to view all the apps you have running at the time. Very handy. But of course this can be reprogrammed too. The thumb area has a rubberised coating which feels quite nice on the thumb but I will say I preferred the Performance MX thumb grip to this one as it had more grip.\nThe rubberised area stops as it meets the back and top of this mouse. Here it turns to a plastic material which does have a slight mat coating which feels OK when the palm is resting on it and so far doesn't seem to make me sweat while using it, which is always a plus.\nThe far side where your pinky finger rests is also rubberised for comfort. This makes lifting the mouse all the much easier unlike their earlier G602 gaming mouse.\nThe thumb side of the mouse has a side scrolling wheel and two buttons. I must say the placement of these buttons could have been better thought out. They seem to have squashed them together. I think it would of worked better if there was just one button either side of the scroll wheel.\nI have reprogrammed these buttons to be cut and paste as I do a lot of file management on my computer systems so I use those functions all the time.\nThe side scrolling wheel is of a beautiful quality. I could scroll this wheel all day as I love the smoothness of it. Unfortunately that's where my love for this wheel dies a death. The rubberised grip on the wheel attracts dust and small debris. Once something is stuck inside the grip it is very hard to remove it. Also I don't really often have a reason to side scroll really. Seems a bit of a novelty. Unless you use spreadsheets a lot. There is good news though. You can reprogramme it. You don't have as many options with this though. For example you cant assign a macro to this wheel. But what I did was select the 'page back and forwards' option. This means when I scroll upwards it goes a page forwards and when I scroll downwards it goes backwards. This might seem a little weird at first but I got used to it surprisingly fast.\nThe main vertical scroll wheel has the 'free-wheel' function MX users will be used to. By default the button above the wheel engages and releases the gears of the wheel. This way if your looking through a long document or webpage, you can press this button to disengage the gears and the wheel will spin freely, allowing you to scroll down or up extremely fast. I personally decided to change this button to 'Save', and then enable the 'SmartShift' option in the software. This means that the gears will stay engaged on the wheel. But if I give the wheel a sharp spin it will sense this and automatically switch the wheel into free spin mode. It will then re-engage the gear after it stops. And this works really well! I love this feature. And you can even set the sensitivity of this.\nOK so the feature that really sold this mouse to me was the FLOW system. Enabling this in the software means you can drag the mouse pointer to the edge of the screen on you PC and then it will appear on the screen of your Laptop. It is quite handy if you often use your laptop on your PC desk at the same time while using your PC. This way you can use just one mouse for the two computers and amazingly you can even copy files from one to another. You press copy on your PC for example, then move your mouse to your laptop screen and click paste. Whallah! Unfortunately you can't drag and drop files but that's not a big problem.\nSo all in all this mouse is impressive in certain ways and a let down in others. I feel the mouse needs more buttons. One or two more on top like the G602, and one or two more OR just a reconfigure of button placement on the side. The thumb wheel, although a nice novelty, it needs to  have more programmable options to be useful.\nThe size and ergonomics of the mouse is good and I wouldn't say much improvement is needed there. But the feel of it could be nicer. The battery seems to be amazing. I've had it just over 2 months and I've only charged it once since it came out of the box. The battery indicator was on two lights when I opened it and it is was still on two lights after over 2 weeks usage. It boasts up to 70 days of use between charges and it seems to be telling the truth.\nWhat's great though is it's supplied with a USB cable which you can plug into the front of the mouse in order to charge it and keep on using it while you do. Brill!\nAnother quick mention too is the dark field laser technology which is superb. This mouse will work on even clear glass as long as it's a minimum of 4mm thick. And the range of this mouse is 10m.\nIf this was helpful please click the 'Yes' button below as then I'll know I helped someone :)"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I've waited a month before writing my review in order to get a proper use of the mouse. This is based on a Mac-user perspective.\nFor years I swore in the Magic Mouse and after that the Magic Trackpad 2 which were always my primary external peripherals. I hesitated for long time to buy the MX Master 2S, but everyone on youtube was recommending it and I decided to give it a try. I am so happy I did.\nPROS\n- great customisation - almost every button can be set to run different keyboard commands based on app used. There's a very nice implementation of the Mac OS commands (by using only the button where the thumb rests) such as Mission Control, Show Desktop, App Expose, switch fullscreen apps/desktops (see attached screenshot)\n- very good battery life (I get several weeks of usage)\n- very comfortable (needs some getting used to after the Magic Mouse, but not so much)\n- nice sliding on my desk without need for mousepad (the Magic Mouse 2 is much worse in this regard)\n- ability to quickly switch between 3 devices by pressing the small button under the mouse\n- flow software to go from the screen of one computer to another is great addition (although it lags a bit for few seconds, so it's not like you have external monitor plugged in, but works the same - you go to the edge of one screen and you are on to the next one)\nCONS (a little nitpicking)\n- the scroll is not as smooth as the Magic Mouse' capacitive surface, but still one of the best on a regular mouse with a wheel\n- no battery percentage in the Logi app, not even in the Mac bluetooth menu icon\n- needs USB-C, I'm tired of this Micro-USB\n- can't set the side scroll wheel to run keystroke commands\n- can't export settings from the Logi app and import them on another computer\n- gets dirty easier than the Magic Mouse and it's harder to clean\nI would usually rate this at 4.5 stars, but if the cons are resolved (or at least half of them), it would be a true 5-star-product.\nClick \"helpful\" if this helped in any way :)"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I've had a Logitech MX Performance for years and it's been thrown carelessly into my laptop bag and travelled the world without a care.
