So when you hear 60s tracks they are light on bass, but when you get past the 80s the bass is heavier and the headphones reflect that, never more so than in this case where the bass response is sensitive for that is the fashion at the moment; you will get a lot of bass. Doesn't suit everybody which is why my hi-fi has a graphic equalizer to combat excessive bass response of the headphones. Closed back but you will get a little leakage though not much, if you want that much isolation you have to spend more (to take out what Microphone people call 'shock sensitivity' e.g. stroke the headphones with your finger and you will hear it) or go to noise cancellation type headphones.\nNevertheless these are quite reasonable headphones, very comfortable and cover the ears unless you have big ears, good quality sound for this price point and robustly made. I think the innovation of the plug-in cables is excellent one red 6.3mm stereo to a 3.5mm stereo, so you can plug it in either can (larger socket on one can, smaller socket on the other), a black cable 3.5mm stereo to 3.5mm stereo plus vocal (3 black rings). Foldable so I will end up using it for my MP3 player as it will give more isolation when on the bus than the in-ear things I'm using. Good Value."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"After many attempts to find a suitable replacement, for my old  Sennheiser 330's,  I came upon these, from OneOdio .The price drew my attention, and having read the reviews and checked the description, I made my purchase. They arrived very quickly, the packaging and product finish, is excellent, and so now to the performance.. Making allowance for my age,and natural hearing wear and tear, I was still surprised just how much detail I had slowly lost over the years, When playing music that I was very familiar with ( which is always a good idea)  it was really nice to hear the full range of the spectrum again. Highly recommended.  P G Croft."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I love deep, rich, bass and had resigned myself after a few weeks of searching for the perfect headphones, that I would have to spend upwards of Â£250.... but then I happened upon the reviews for these beauties!!! Incredible value for money and amazing bass!!! Don't understand how OneOdio have done it for less than Â£30, but very very glad they did.  Big thanks to them and to the customer reviews that led me down this path ðŸ˜Š"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These are brilliant. The sound from my hi fi especially audiophile vinyl. They also give excellent sound from my phone."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I love these headphones!! I have the DJ version of these headphones by Onedio, so I knew that they were going to be a quality product, and I was not disappointed in any way. I have never used wireless headphones, but they were simple to set up, and are now my go to cans, for listening to my music. The sound quality is really good, has plenty of bass, but it is not over powering. The Treble sounds are clear and have no tinny sounds to them. They add a fantastic tone, ambience and warmth to the music, and u can hear all the different layers of any track being played, the vocal track is emphasised and has clarity, no muffling or distortion, they are, in all honesty, vastly better than I expected, for the price. The cups are well padded and fit beautifully and are comfortable to use for long periods. They are powerful enough, but not excessive, so u can have the volume at a comfortable level, without bursting ur eardrums, but u could, if u chose too!! I love the sound blocking and draining ability, u can't hear too much peripheral noise around u and other people don't hear what ur listening to either, so ur not going to annoy anyone around u. I love these headphones and they are as good a quality as any of the expensive brands. Quality and value in one. Would highly recommend these, and Onedio too. They produce a quality range of products. I would never be afraid of buying from them, time and time again. Thank you Onedio, please keep producing excellent products."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Good headphones, good sound although I do understand why other people want more bass, and the \"adapter free\" method is usefull for me because I have a keyboard which I connect using the 6.5 and everything else with the 3.5.\nThere is only one thing that I don't like neither understand about them which is why I removed one star. The swivelling ear-cups have 90 degree turn IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. As in, both ear-cups rotate inwards not outwards if you place your headphones with the Left-Right configuration suggested so you are not able to single-hear the ear-cups because they are rotated in the oppposite direction.\nOf course this can be fixed by placing your headphones \"inverted\" (Right-Left on Left-Right ears) which feel exactly the same but now you have left-right sound inverted and given that I use them for playing video games as well, this kind of matters.\nSo, I really don't know why they inverted the swivelling angle, perhaps because DJs have Left-Right in the opposite of the audience in a concert but I found it wierd and thats the only thing I don't like about them.\nI only removed"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Headphones are good quality and sturdy, music sounds great through them, nothing overpowering and cancels out noise really well. However, not as loud as I expected them to be.\nLove the wires that come with them, very strong and generous in length.\nHeadphones are quite bulky and on the heavy side, not extremely comfy but the material is nice and soft doesnâ€™t get sweaty.\nI like that theyâ€™re collapsible, move in all directions and compact but can be a nuisance when youâ€™re trying to unwind and put them on quickly. Headphones are marked with L & R, no controls on the headphones for volume etc.\nOne of the wires has a built in mic and button for accepting calls.\nI bought these because I have new piercings and canâ€™t use earphones for now.\nWish it came with a case."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"The headphones are comfortable and the sound is good.\nIt comes with a long red cable with a 6.3mm jac at one end and a 3.5mm at the other, and a shorter black cable with a 3.5mm on either end which has a microphone on it.\nFor the red cable, the headphones will allow either end to plug into them, so you whether your device has a 6.3 or 3.5 you should be able to use the  cable the necessary way round, though I've only tried the 6.3mm plugged into the headphones and the 3.5mm into my PC/Phone.\nThe black cable (with the mic) for just music was fine, but when using the microphone for me was very crackly and the mic overly sensitive making it pretty unusable, just moving my head side to side caused crackling when looped back into my ears, and if you were using that for chat/phone/skype etc it'd be torture for the person you're speaking to even if you can't hear it (if you dont have mic monitoring on) so don't expect to be able to the included mic... but for purely audio, you're fine and I'm sure you'll be happy with these headphones."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"The large jack input works well. You would call the sound as clear, but lacking warmth. There's a small reliance on very high tones. For DJ's and rappers this is good for studio work. It might effect your final mix with dance music, so I recommend using high end headphones before releasing tunes on iTunes etc.\nWARNING: The mini headphone jack is useless. Tried and tested with a very high quality minijack to mini jack and a Plenue Cowen D hi-fi MP3 player known for its 'quality' by audiophiles. Used normal and 'funk' setting for contrast. Had to pump up sound 3x for the same sound level vs Sennheiser HD 205 II's. The port is its only let down.\nSimple but secure boxing and a volume adjuster on wire.\nFor low price headphone set for studio, this is isn't a bad investment. It's a very good 'value' product. I'd pay 40 quid as RRP not 79. For DJ's it works well. For sound mixing, I'd go with another brand or wait until this manufacturer sends a pair to What HiFi to review"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I have no issues with the sound quality, they sound exactly like they should for the price and I have no complaints there. My issue is with the build quality. They creak and crack just from being held, they feel quite loosely put together and when using them wired, even after only having them for a few weeks, one of the ears cuts out and can only be fixed by twisting the cable. I have tested this on multiple devices with multiple cables, one of which was purchased brand new and taken out of the box specifically to test them.\nI previously purchased the OneOdio studio wired headphones and they felt much more sturdy than these, I understand compromises must be made in order to keep prices down, but I would prefer to pay a bit more to have sturdier headphones. These are bluetooth headphones, which means chances are they'll be taken outside. These are nowhere near sturdy enough to be \"Outside headphones\". The entire housing is put together from cheap plastic and feels light and hollow.\nWhile this might sound like a nitpick, I feel as though comfort is important when choosing headphones. Remember you might be wearing these for hours a day, but even if you aren't, it's good to have them be comfortable. The earcups on these headphones are thin and uncomfortable. I don't have huge ears or a huge head, but the cups are made of a very soft material, which is fine on larger earcups like on their other headphones but on these it just causes them to mash down and feel like my head is against bare plastic. I would recommend swapping out the earcups if you do buy these, although I can't recommend a replacement as I haven't bought any.\nAll in all, they sound good but they're not where they should be in terms of build quality, which is a shame as I've previously had good experiences with the brand."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I use the headphones and the battery life is great. I use it for Spotify, netflix and general computer usage. I also use them at work for making and receiving calls and on my macbook pro the quality of the microphone is really bad and not many can hear me properly.\nI do like the quality of the sound when listening to output, but at least from my usage on a site called zendesk and skype the mic quality has been bad and I have tried messing with the settings but nothing has worked.\nI really do like that you can unplug the mic and use it on the headphone jack but I end up switching the mic to my macs mic for better communication. Shame really because its really why I bought the headphones and already have some sennheisers and boze wired in case I forget to charge them (like today)"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I already have a pair of bose noise cancelling phones which cost the earth, but since I wear headphones so much, I wore them out and thought to replace them with a cheaper version. My old noise cancelling phones didn't completely cover my ears and a pair of passive over the ear headphones should work just as well for my journey on the tube. These really did the trick. Very comfortable, good sound quality and lasted .... well, as long as a pair this price would last. So in summary\nPros:\n- Good sound\n- Comfortable\n- Good noise protection in the tube without it being noise cancelling\n- Great feature to be able to connect the whire from both headphones\n- Very flexible headphones so a good fit.\nCons:\n- Cord was very very long for what I needed, annoyingly so\n- Though flexible, it was this that broke first, the swivel broke in the bag.\n- Sound socket didn't connect properly after a while\n... eventually I paid a big more and moved onto a wireless headphones, which have so far been excellent!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Truly excellent at the price, perfect for guitarists or other musicians including DJ's as it has a proper Â¼\" jack plug which goes into an amp, not a split jack which more than often loses it's contact, the small 6.3mm goes into the headphones, the lead is just the right size and is partially coiled so you do not trip up on it, and the headphone sound is excellent and they are fold-able! 10/10 :)."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I don't normally write reviews on Amazon, but these have impressed me so much that I had to write one. I bought these for Bluetooth use mainly for call taking and video conferences. However, the sound quality really is amazing for this price. I have heard headphones costing hundreds that are not as good. I am an audiophile so have high expectations on sound quality and these have surprised me. So impressed. The headphones are not perfect but it would be wrong to pick fault for this much quality sound and flexibility at this price. I have had no issues at all using them. Highly recommended at this price!"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"At first, I loved these headphones. Bluetooth connection was easy to set up, they had a good feel to them so didn't feel too cheap, however will be returning them as the microphone just isn't up to standard for calls which is one thing I needed these headphones for.\nOtherwise, sound quality is okay, not amazing but good for the price of the headphones so a good buy for someone who doesn't need them for the microphone."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"If you're looking for a pair of great sounding DJ headphones for less than Â£80, these should be your first choice, hands down.\nAt Â£26, they outperform pretty much anything with amazing, detailed sound. Plenty of bass, clear mids and high and a detailed, proper hi end sound thanks to it's neodymium drivers (usually only seen in higher end products)\nBuild quality is pretty decent for this price point, even tough some higher end models will feel less plastic, they do feel solid and durable. Pads are made of thick leatherette. A good point compared to the thin stuff usually seen on many headphones that tends to get leprosy after a while and flake out in the most unsatisfying manner. Design is sober and classy with decent finish.\nComfort is great. Even tough it's not as well padded as the Pro vesion, you can wear them for hours on end. Noise isolation is pretty good, which is essential for club use.\nThe detachable cable is a great idea, Any DJ will know the frustration of loosing those damn 1/4\" adaptors. Main cable is 2 meter long, with a small coil that serves more as a stress relief than a proper way of extending the cable and avoiding knots. Cable itself seems well built and durable. Also comes with a phone style cable, which I had the weird feel of it producing a somewhat \"lighter sound\". Something Some Youtubers have said. Can't really confirm this tho. Maybe I was sort of expecting it because of previous reviews?\nOverall, one of the best budget, Sub Â£100 headphones you can buy, I'd assume only topped by their pro version."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"The headphones arrived at the time promised. They were well packed and came in a very small box. They fold down very small.\nMy first impression was they looked very good and were well made.\nThey come with two leads with different sized plugs and therefore fit both full size hi fi and small portable devices.\nThe sound is very clear and detailed and uniform across all frequencies. I like these headphones very much. You get a very good set of headphones for very little money."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I have a pair of Beyerdynamic  dtx 350 m, because I like a crystal-clear sound for some of the stuff I listen to. Nevertheles, I was in need of a comfortable, more spatial and bassy pair of headphones, specially for working at my desk. The beyers sound amazing, but they feel somewhat uncomfortable after a few hours, because of the cheap build and the tightness. And, honestly, I was missing a fair amount of bass for my more \"spectral\" music. So I searched Amazon for something cheap, read some reviews and decided to go with the OneOdios. I'm really satisfied with them, as they are really comfortable for long listening sessions (though, if you use glasses like me, you'll feel a little bit of crackling between the plastic and the earpads when moving your head, but not that much). They bring quite a lot of punch, with decent \"vibration\" and surround, although not that much as to outshine mids and highs. I listen to lots of ambient and drone music while working, and I find them to be really good at that, as they have decent isolation and the sound feels whole, deep and open: a relaxed sound that doesn't get tiresome, but that's not mudded either. It's also really good that cables are intercheangable, and that it comes with two  (a DJ cable, for monitoring, and a standard one). Plastic feels a little bit cheap, but they work really well when in use, and I don't feel that they will break when I put them on or inside my bagpack (it happens with my beyer). Again, I feel that they are comfortable, not too tight, and cozy over the head, thanks to the good headband. Oh, and if you don't dig ambient music, I've tried them with pop and rock and they do the job just as well (but they are really bassy, as I said, or at least by my standards). I wouldn't use them for walking whatsoever, only indoors, as they are BIG. I put them on my bagpack (carefully and on an empty pocket, as they don't come with a case or bag... that would've been nice!) to bring them to the library, and use them there or at home. Haven't tried them with anything that's not music, like movies or videogames. Overall, excellent headphones for the price! Delivery was perfect, everything came in mint condition."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Been using different brands each time the padded foam of my headphone started to fall apart. A little skeptical about the price would give me anything amazing, but it's really a good bargain! How long will it last, that we don't know, but it has been 2 hours i'm using it and i'm already adding more in my basket in order to replace the rest of headphones in the house.\nAgain with this kind of price, i'm not expecting any full bodied solid sound, but it will not give you cheap sound either, after all,  you get what you pay for, and i'm happy with it.\nGo on, give it a try.\nThe ear cup blocked out most noises, yet doesn't make your ears ache or uncomfortable, not feel hot.\nGold plated jack is what you get, which also one thing in particular i insist of when i'm buying headphone or earphone.\nThe overall look also  very nice, looks like expensive stuff."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"I bought these for  work in that i use them exclusively in the office.  They remain plugged in and when i don't use them they sit on my desk.  I  do use them every day.  The headphones themselves are pretty good,  they all but eliminate the annoying sounds of my colleagues chatting rubbish all day.  The sound quality is just fine - i'm no audiophile but they sound plenty good enough.  That said, they have started to fall to pieces.  I think that yesterday was the fourth time  that i  have needed to fix an essential piece of plastic that has out of the blue just broken.  They are now held together with glue and until yesterday this was enough but an essential hingey bit broke yesterday and supeglue just won't cut it.  I have had them for I suppose 17 months and i suppose that  they are pretty cheap etc but they could for sure be made a little better than they are."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I am unfortuneatly starting this review with a negative . Through circumstance that exist in my home I am required to use headphones with a long lead, the Sennheiser pair that these are replacing had a nine foot lead, I searched quite thoroughly for a pair of headphones with a long lead and that is why I purchased this pair. However, upon opening the box I found  the lead is only just six foot  long with a curled up portion of six inches that proved practically useless, far too much tension required for any extension.\nNow for the positive.. Anyone who critisizes the quality of the experience of listening to music through this pair must be used to high quality reproduction. The experience for me after using Sennheiser was amazing, superior by some degree.\nThe headphones are very comfortable to wear and  the ear is covered completely. Bass is good as well as the higher notes. The short lead cost one star.  All in all, for the money a good buy!"},{"rating":"1.0","content":"I thought they looked good..I'm sitting here writing this just after my 1st trial with them..plug sockets ,small jack didn't work at all, coming through one speaker. As soon as I opened them ,I wasn't happy ,cheap made..nasty infact..I thought with them being reduced from Â£70 to 20..they can't be bad ..there worse..sending them back."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Honestly this is an amazing headset. It's comfortable, has an amazing sound quality and the Bluetooth connectivity is great.\nIt can be used as a wireless headset for listening to music, can be used as a standard pair of headphones and gaming headset and mic.\nIt is great value for such an amazing pair of headphones.\nThe only issue is using it using it as a headset for the PS4.\nThere is an odd problem where the mic doesn't work when the headset is plugged into a Dualshock 4 controller. But only some controllers, as tried it on someone else's ps4 and it worked with one controller and not the other.\nI contacted the company who made the headset and they sent me out a replacement absolutely free. While the issue still persisted, I have to say it is great customer service."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These headphones are very good both in terms of sound quality and also fit.  I have a hearing impaired relative who needs the crispest sound and she felt they were the best tried so far (I ordered her a second set).  The headphones look robust but might be a bit bulky for some people and not best for travelling light.  I think they are more a professional product design.  They are comfortable to wear unless they are put on the wrong way round in which case they pinch the ears somewhat - check that the ear pieces twist inwards to the front before putting on."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"I was so disappointed with the sound quality. Supposedly advertised at over Â£70 but reduced on promotion. I took the original cost as an indicator of the quality I'd get. There is no way these cans would compare with leading brands of a similar price. Disappointed, I retuned them and got a refund."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"i bought these headphones to match my lovely red rig (photo provided) and to finally start talking to people online as I like to online game.\nUnfortunately, I came under a lot of issues.\nThe first issue was a discrepancy between whether or not it's exclusively Bluetooth or not. As we are provided with an adapter cable so it's insinuated that it can be Wired headphones. But my experience was far from it.\nDay 1: I knew from previous experiences Wired Headphones can be annoying when it comes to Audio Feedback Loops (basically when you speak into the microphone it causes an echo) and sure enough when I connected my headphones to my PC it immediately had a bad case of feedback loop happening.\nAfter 2 hours I somehow managed to fix the issue (I feel half the blame lies on the headphones and the other half on Realtek a really quite terrible audio software which comes with Windows 10). I digress, So i fixed the issue and began playing TF2 for a few hours. I had a lot of fun, met some nice people; the works.\nDay 2; I once again play some games confident the issue was gone. I play TF2 for about an hour when my friends begin to complain they can't understand what I am saying. Sure enough, the Audio Feedback Loop happened again and it was torture. I tried fiddling with it for about 15 minutes trying to adjust the cables to the front (and back of my pc, as I have Audio Jacks at the back too hoping it could be a faulty jack on my rig) but nope. nothing I tried worked.\nI gave up and connected the red cable directly to my Monitor so at least I could listen to the game, It continues having this weird ghostly back noise I still haven't managed to fix.\nDay 3: On Day three I was annoyed and committed to fixing this issue once and for all, after another 3 hours NOTHING. I adjusted the cables location, The audio settings, the microphone's settings, I tried everything I could think of and it did jack diddly squat. I heard noises ranging from spooky ghosts humming, to grinding lasers, to Alien Space ships. you name it I heard all the weird noises.\nI even found a spare Male to Male audio cable I had thinking that could finally fix the issue, and that maybe the red cable was damaged but no, even that didn't fix the issue. I gave up and purchased the cheapest Bluetooth USB 4.0 adapter I could find on Amazon, which when including shipping cost me an additional â‚¬20.\nToday:\nToday my brother managed to source another 2 male: 1 female adapter we have at my house, a really old one. and I'm going to give it one last shot and see if I can change the cables out to resolve that issue.\nConclusion: Please don't advertise your product as being Wired/Wireless and even provide customers with Cables to connect to PC's (even including 2 male to female audio adapters) if when they try to use them, they don't work or make their ears bleed. Just provide us with a Bluetooth adapter instead. (My only other final suspicion is the Microphone itself is damaged, but I have no way of testing this)\nI'm still holding out hope that once I get the Bluetooth adapter the Headphones will work fine, but if not I'm gonna have to return these to you. They're really nicely designed and when they did work I enjoyed them very much but it's been 4 days now and nothing I've tried so far has worked.\nI don't want to rank it lower because technically when it did work, it did, in fact, sound fine and was good for gaming.\nEDIT: 12/3/19  it's garbage losing another star. i got the bluetooth adapter, set everything up properly and the audio quality is terrible sounds like an old nokia brick. I chatted to people online and they said the microphone sounded just as bad. The Headphones are awful and the microphone is awful. Returning this product the second i get a chance."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I bought this for use with my phone, to listen to music, podcasts, audiobooks, but also to make calls, so the microphone is important to me. I had a negative experience with another headset where the microphone is on the headphone itself - others complained that they could not hear me very well.\nNot sure how long the bendy mic on this new headset will last, but it works much better - no complaints at all about it.\nSound quality of the headphones is good as well.\nThe quibbles? The reach is very short so you got to stay close to your source, and the headset is a wee bit too small for my big head - i can use it, but it becomes uncomfortable after a (long) while."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought two of these at Christmas 2018 for my 'boys' (22 and 20) and they loved them. They use them all the time and they said wee great. So I bought some for myself. There are lots of good things to say: 1. Sound quality is excellent - the best headphones I have owned in my 59 years (versus SONY, SENNHEISSER, AKG and others) 2. Very comfortable 3. Very long battery life 4. They feel well built.\nThe one shortcoming is a 'beep' in between tracks when playing albums. I contacted OneOdio and they were very helpful. Apparently it is a feature of bluetooth with iPhone users using iOS12 only. This is fine for pop music but affects the ambience for classical music - hence 4 stars rather than 5.\nSo I will use these headphones wired to listen to classical music. For the wireless functionality I have upgraded to these OneOdio headphones.\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/OneAudio-Wireless-Headphones-Bluetooth-Playtime-black/dp/B07MCTKS14?ref_=bl_dp_s_web_14306471031\n- they are little bit more expensive and don't fold quite so small, but they have the same build quality but a different bluetooth chipset.\n[Note: I originally gave 4 stars because of this beeping shortcoming. But I am just listening to Faure's Requiem with the headphones wired and the sound is amazing - the headphones cope excellently with the enormous bass  power of the organ and choir. It's like re-discovering the music! It seems unfair to give anything other than 5 stars]"},{"rating":"1.0","content":"I don't really like leaving bad reviews without giving the seller chances to resolve issues first however since the lack of option to contact the seller I have no choice... the headphones themselves are good quality and comfortable - I can wear them all day at work without them pressing on my rook ear piercing and they block office sounds out quite well. They have however started to fall apart after 3 months of occasional use. One of the pins has fallen out which means they don't fit to my ears anymore making them both uncomfortable and essentially useless.\nI have since found the pin under my desk but even when put back in it falls out easily (at least 3 times a day). I'm reluctant to glue it in incase I stick a moving mechanism by accident and spoil the comfort of them. I'm not sure if this is a common issue but would like it if the seller could resolve this."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought these on sale for under Â£20. So from the outset they were favourable. Upon opening the box, I was a little disappointed that there was no hard case or drawcord bag. The Headphones were neatly folded, the 6.3mm & 3.5mm cables were securely bagged. I tested the headphones out on about 75% volume to ease them in, listening to a variety genres, the speaker response was impressive. If you have a Dolby Atmos on your device, you are winning. The combination of good hardware and premium software does not disappoint. On the flip side, if you don't have premium software these headphones will still perform superbly. The earcups are reasonably padded, the headband is comfortable (both areas are wrapped in synthetic
