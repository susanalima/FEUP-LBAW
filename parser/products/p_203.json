{"weight":"331 g","model":"AUD ATHAD500X","release_date":"10 April 2013","price":"£96.99","name":"Audio-Technica ATH-AD500X Open backed Hi-Fi headphones","stock":85,"brand":"Audio-Technica","q_a":[{"q":"How do these compare to ath-m40x?","a":"AD500x are much bigger, extremely comfortable with wide and deep soundstage. M40 are closed type so they project the sound inside your head - a bit claustrophobic experience to me but the sound characteristic is quite similar, both offers flat, neutral sound unlike very dynamic Ultrasone"},{"q":"Does this need an AMP or anything along those lines?","a":"No, no amp is needed! I have them and glad I brought them... Very open sound, I love mine!"},{"q":"Does it have a mic?","a":"No mic unfortunatley , I brought an Antlion mod mic for mine."},{"q":"Is my laptop a good enough audio source for this headphone set?","a":"These headphones have a nice low impedence, and run reasonably well from any source. Quality does improve with a good dac/amp but its not a necessity, and it doesnt improve much as compared to something like the q701/702/712 etc"},{"q":"Is my laptop a good enough audio source for this headphone set?","a":"I had these briefly and they are too harsh, not enough base and I'm no base head and the mediums and highs over power the sets. I used them with iPhone, MacBook Pro and Arcam amp and I'd say the MacBook was worst option for powering these so my answer would be no."},{"q":"Has anyones used these with glasses? Are they comfortable or do the press the glasses up against your head.","a":"They are comfortable but they are weird af. Try them on for 30mins and you'll see. I can't explain it. But after i bend it with brute force, the problem is solved and they became ultra comfortable for me."},{"q":"Is there much leakage from these headphones?","a":"Yes. There open back headphones so do not keep the sound in"},{"q":"Why are there no more pictures? New model? Are these comfortable for big a head? Never head a comfy headset before","a":null},{"q":"Why are they so expensive in the uk when they cost 79 dollars in the us?","a":null}],"reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","content":"Decided to write a review on these as im so impressed with them. They are the most comfortable headphones I have ever owned , the design of the 3D wings is a clever idea, they sit to each side if your head with gentle pressure that you hardly notice. For a large headphone they are very lightweight and can be worn for ages with no problems at all. The huge ear cups fit around your ears in a cozy  soft fabric covered foam that does not make you sweat like the plasticky type fabric used on other brands.\nThe sound as immense presence due to the 54mm drivers, when switching to these from my other headphones I have to turn the volume down they are so powerful .They handle a broad range of sound that tends to favour the bass end a little, but are quite capable dealing with the high notes. I have heard notes that I have never heard before with my other cheaper brands.\nI would recommend these to those of you that like pop, rock, trance and modern dance music as they can really handle lots of bass if that's your thing."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"These headphones are way overpriced.\nThe build quality, whilst very lightweight, feels rather cheap. They also do not have a removable cable, which is a big downside. And even worse, the cable is permanently trying to coil itself back up to the way it was packaged. And the cable doesn't feel that strongly attached to the headphones - and i fear with an accidental yank, you could easily tear out the cable, rendering the headphones useless.\nIn regards to sound quality, i put my ~7 year old Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro 250 ohm headphones to rest, after a good amount of service life out of them. And comparing the audio quality of those, to these Audio Technicas? They are a big drop in audio quality. It doesn't sound so clear, or crisp compared to my DT 990's. However the audio is still slightly better than those budget £30 - £35 headphones companies try to sell off as \"premium gaming headphones\".\nThe main selling point of these, is the soundstage. Due to the design, directional audio is VERY good, and far better than any 7.1 headsets i've tried. It helps a lot with gaming, particularly FPS games. Also very nice for ASMR videos, providing you are in a quiet environment - as the open design does allow a lot of sound to both escape, and enter.\nThese should not be sold for higher than £45 - £50 imo."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Brought these for gaming with the antlion mic, after using them for a month I cannot picture going back to gaming headsets. Very comfortable though I have a narrow head so had to squeez the arch in a little for them to be firm but that is/was expected from reviews I had already seen. I can use these constantly for hours, with my razor closed headset I was comfortable for a little over an hour.\nSound is very good more focused on treble but bass was better than expected for an open set and either got better with use or I got used to it.\nI can recommend for most music but not for you if you are heavy bass focused."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I'm not an audiophile but I can say that the clarity of these headphones is far better than anything I've previously had.  The open backs mean the sound stage is excellent and they are extremely light and very comfortable.  Only two downside that I've noticed:\n1. The 3D wing support is rubbish.  It's not strong enough to support the headphones on your head properly, if you shake your head or body the headphones will slip down off your ears.  There are workarounds such as attaching some elastic between the wings which will stop them spreading to far but when you are paying £113 for something you don't expect to need to implement workarounds to get it functioning correctly.\n2. The bigger problem though is the fixed cable.  As others have commented on, the cable quality is not great and you can't change it out.  No matter how much I try, I cannot get the cable straightened out, it has a habit of trying to curl itself back up which is irritating enough on its own but it's also quite long and there's no way of shortening it without having a coiled up cable lying around.\nOverall I'm happy with the purchase but some minor design flaws stop this being a 5 star review."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Not great if you're looking for booming bass, but the soundstage and quality of sound is amazing.\nThis is perfect for gaming headphones, though if you're looking to stream with a camera be aware you won't look very cool as the band sticks up away from your head.\nThere is some sound leakage, but when using a modmic (attachable headphone mic), not much sound is picked up unless at high volumes."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"When I first got the headphones they were amazing! Great sound. But after a few months they developed a defective contact which made one side less loud, sometimes it wouldn't even work at all. I received a replacement from amazon but after roughly a year the same issue surfaced again. Faulty contact on 2 items, I can not recommend these headphones due to its bad manufacturing quality for this price."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Best Headset I have EVER Bought and at a Very Reasonable Price..Would Certainly Recommend them to People who are Hard of Hearing and Glasses Wearers..Considering Buying another Set to Connect to TV in Living Room..This Set is Connected to Gaming PC and is Superb and Very Comfortable...."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Use these as gaming headphones with a modmic.\nThese are such a vast improvement over my Logitech G930 which I was using previously. I can hear things I couldn't hear before in game!\nListening to music they sound great so well worth the expense."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"They just can't stay in position....are they designed for baloon headed ppl?\nEdit/update : they became  so uncomfortable that if I could ask for a refound i would.  The lack of any slider to adjust the fit is unbearable and the price I paid was just ludicrously high given these flaws."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Only had it for a few days, but so far it is great, The headphones are really comfortable, and for a person with a big head like me the fit perfectly, but they can become a little bit warm and heavy after some time. The audio quality beats anything I've had so far (not really saying much I had a Logitech G13 headset before, while not the best, it did the job), but I am  really happy with this purchase, and I think Audio Technica has earned itself a permanent customer"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"amazing, i love these headphones, i use them for gaming and you can hear footsteps, bullets dropping, tires screeching so much more than my other pair of headphones, only negative as there's little to no base with them but other than that there brilliant."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Although these were returned I'm still giving them 5 stars based on the fact that the sound and build quality was very good. They were a gift for someone who felt they were too big and with them being studio headphones this was to be expected."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Well made piece of kit very comfortable, durable and the sound quality is good"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great quality but can sometimes get quite uncomfortable if you have a small head and annoyingly long cable but they are just brilliant."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"They are good"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Except for the cable. Everything just fine"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I returned these headphones just because they are abit too big to me. Otherwise they have quality build and performance."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"nice balanced sound but a bit flat and boring"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"My son is very pleased with these"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Very comfy"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These headphones are incredible. I went back to try my old Razer ones and I couldn't stand it.\nThe build quality is fantastic, they are light enough that it barely feels like they are on my head!\nI've managed to wear them for 8-9 hour periods in one go and had no discomfort at all.\nThey are a perfect balance for bass, mid and treble and work excellent with my soundcard.\nI only have two minor issues:\nThe cable is taking a long time to forget it's original boxed position, so it tends to curve around and almost tangle.\nI don't think it would fit too comfortably on a smaller persons head, the cups are too low down when my girlfriend uses them.\nI love these headphones and have owned them now for 5 months with no issues. I highly recommend these if you can afford them, they are excellent."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"These are my Xmas 2016 pressie.  Well happy as well.  I originally had a pair of BeyerDynamic DT770 250 Ohm cans that lasted about 7 years before the daughter got her hands on them and then I had them returned with the bass gone.  Stored away to await resurrection in the future, but I loved them and was trying to get a pair of cans that would come close to them - times have moved on? I have had a home studio of varying sizes according to the necessities of living - I had one a couple of years back with insulated walls, foam all over the walls and ceiling and a floating floor, doing mainly guitar oriented projects but using a M-Audio Axiom Air now as a MIDI controller/keyboard and using an old Mac Pro with 2x4 cores on board, 26GB and Yosemite running Logic X and a Roland Tri-Capture interface as well as a Windows 7 machine with an i3, 16GB of fast DDR3 and SSD running Cubase Elements with a Presonus Inspire 1394  running Firewire through a TI chip equipped PCI card.  Got a pair of Audio-Technica ATH-PRO700MK2 phones from fleabay for a song and thought those would do the trick - they don't.  They were HORRIBLE.  I don't know how a) Audio-Technica can put their name to such a piece of junk, and b) how they get away with charging so much for them.  The bass was so overwhelming that it distorted everything from 400Hz up.  Lots of bass yes, but at the expense not only of top end but mid range as well?....they\nwent back on fleabay, sold for more than what I'd paid for them. I think that says it all.  Then got a pair of AKG K77s from Amazon to tide me over till Xmas and also to act as my new closed phones. The AD500Xs are of course, open.  These K77s are OK, I haven't \"burned them in\" using white and pink noise, but as reviewers on other sites have pointed out, you really shouldn't have to burn ANY cans in, because the manufacturer would hardly sell a piece of kit needing that sort of treatment - and I understand.  Yes, I can accept large paper diaphragms on big floor standing speakers may need breaking in, but polypropylene 15mm drivers?  I don't think so.  These K77s are very midrange light to my ears and not very revealing at all - very muddy and also not very efficisteven wilson\nent - they are pretty quiet. So. Xmas comes round and I'm writing this on New Years Day.  Not a lot of time to judge, so these are my first impressions If you're not used to open cans as I was, be prepared to be shocked.  These are very revealing.  You can literally hear everything and\n the soundstage is wonderful.  The bass is not too untidy either - I ran Nick Beggs' excellent work on \"Luminol\" by Steven Wilson on \"The Raven That Refused To Sing\" and also The Cure's \"The Walk - Everything Mix\" on \"Mixed Up\" through because I knew they were going to sound good.  And they do.  I couldn't track with these - that's not what they're made for.  But listening to commercial music and mixing?  Perfect.  Deducted one point because I don't have the smallest head around (Bloke, 57cm measurement, motorcycle helmet size Medium) and as they come at the smallest adjustment I can't pull them down anymore, which I would like to do, as they are comfortable (but not as comfortable as the velour pads on DT770s) but don't feel totally secure.  As with all open cans - there is bleed from them.  So don't expect to use these in a living room when other family members are trying to watch telly.  It could lead to domestics."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Absolutely fantastic"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Quick good and bad points thing first, for those that do not have much time.\nGOOD\nAmazing sound field and sound quality\nVery competitively priced for such a good listening experience\nLight and comfortable to wear\nBAD\nStupidly long cable\nNo factory seal on the box\nNot good for listening to low quality recordings\nInside use only, not really designed to use when walking around the streets\nI purchased these mostly to listen to music at home and am very happy with them for this purpose. The ATH-500x have proved to be better than my expectations, for this price range. They have been used on a computer, a smart phone, an AV amplifier and a Television.\nMusic - I have mostly been using these to listen to Classical music but have also tried them with a selection of Pop and Rock music dating from the 1970's through to the present day. The sound and sound field on these cans blew me away and they were found to be excellent for all the genres of music, that I tend to listen to, from a well recorded source. The only criticism that I have is that they are so good at reproducing sound that they will pick up every fault in a bad recording or reproduction. I have no Idea of how these sound with Rap or DJ type stuff as I do not listen to this type of music very often.\nSpoken word - Again a well produced video clip or pod-cast is a delight to the ears through the Audio Technicas but listening to a bad source feels like you have put your ears in a paper shredder. This I found out when I hooked these phones up to a mono, Long Wave, radio, to listen to a cricket commentary.\nFilms and TV - I have a pair of headphones specifically designed for this and I have to admit that the AD 500x were not as good as those for watching films and TV series. So if this is the main reason that you want a pair of headphones, you would be well advised to look elsewhere. But having said that and your main purpose for buying these is for music and they are only occasional to be hooked up to the TV or AV system, these still give a nice reproduction for sound accompaniment to visual media.\nComfort and Fit - These are big 'phones but surprisingly light in weight. They have proved comfortable and relatively secure to wear. It is no problem walking around the house and getting on with stuff, whilst listening to these. They would be no good for going jogging though and really are confined to indoor use. There is very little heat build up in the cans (It is July at the time of writing this) due, I presume, to the open backed design. The pads feel good against my head and are secure but do not clamp too hard. Two to three hours continual use has been no problem.\nTHE DOWNSIDES\nSound Leak - These 'phones bleed sound like crazy but they are open backed, so this is only to be expected.\nThe Cable - The three meter cable has not proved to be so bad as some drama queen reviewers on YouTube have been whining about. I coiled most of it up and tied it with freezer bag ties and this has solved that problem. But with good quality cable extensions being cheep and easily available, it is hard to understand why there is not a nice meter and a bit cable on these cans.\nNo Factory Seal - This, I have found, is not a problem specific to this product. It seems that all Audio Technica headphones have no factory seal on their boxes. Headphones are a very personal product and in these times when many people return stuff that they have sourced from the internet it is important to know that such a body intimate product is fresh from the factory and has not been, possibly, pre used by someone with poor cleanliness habits. Audio Technica, you really need to sort your lives out on this point.\nCONCLUSION\nThere are better headphones on the market but most of these cost four or more times the asking price of the Audio Technica ATH-500x headphones. As I am the kind of person who likes to squander their money on fripperies such as paying the mortgage,  putting food on the table, paying fuel bills and other such things that means that there is only so much left in the budget for headphones. These headphones give a real Audiophile experience at a price achievable by many people. They are, to date, the best sounding music headphones that I have ever owned and the ownership experience has so far proved to be a very positive one. They do have a few downsides, nothing is perfect, so out of 100 I would give these a 95 percent and so the five star rating.
