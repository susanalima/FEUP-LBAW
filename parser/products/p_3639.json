The limiting factor will be your sound chip on your motherboard so I highly suggest getting a sound card with an amp."},{"q":"Hows the bass?","a":"Amazing"}],"reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","content":"I normally don't write reviews but.......Put simply: I friggin love these cans.\nI was hesitant to pull the trigger on these at first , because they are 250 ohms and it's generally required to use an amp with these ( which i don't have yet). However , even plugged straight into my Macbook Pro they sound amazing.\nI have a pair of AKG K550s and even though those are lovely headphones , ever since i got these the AKGs are gathering dust. These Beyers have a much better overall sound than the AKGs and the sound stage is just amazing ( i think due to the nature of the open-back design).\nNow one minor gripe i have with these is that the headphones are made out of plastic and not aluminium , but they're incredibly well-built. And being made of plastic, they are quite light and therefore - very comfortable to wear over extended periods of time.\nConsidering the price and the fact that these are Made In Germany , this is an incredible deal in my book. If you are on the hunt for a pair of open-back headphones , definitely give these a shot."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Finally decided to buy some Audiophile headphones and i cannot believe how incredible these sound. I spent a good few months looking into AMP''s/DACs and different brands but didn't want to completely empty bank account.\nI decided on these highly reviewed DT990 250ohm, paired with a FiiO E10K Olympus USB DAC, and the sound is AMAZING.\nAfter reading forum posts and reviews i thought the lack of bass people spoke about would be a bit disappointing but i would use the bass boost option on the DAC to make up for it. But i didn't need too, the bass is really punchy without the boost, and in my opinion for whatever its worth, its the absolute perfect amount.\nThe build quality is really nice although the outside of the ear cups are plastic, they still look smart and feel really sturdy.\nThey are also incredibly light and comfortable, I've recently used them for 8'ish hours straight playing games and they felt comfortable the entire time. No sweaty ears or uncomfortable pressure around my ears.\nFor anyone considering these for PC Gaming, i absolutely recommend getting them, especially with the FiiO E10K DAC. The positional sound is BRILLIANT. I've used Plantronic 780 7.1's,Tritton AX and Kama, Turtle Beach pros,  Razer Kraken 7.1, Corsair HS40 7.1 and Sennheiser PC 350SE but the sound quality and directional sound of these DT990's is massively above all of them. When playing with friends who use similar headphones to what i used to use, i now hear things and can pin point the direction of sounds easier and clearer than they do, whether it be nearby footsteps or distant gunfire. I was even accused of ''wall hacking'' yesterday because i could hear other players around walls and corners so clearly and pre-fired.\nHighly recommend to anyone looking to really up the audio quality of their music or gaming experience. After years of cheap to expensive ''Gaming Headsets'' i wish i had bought a DAC and decent Audiophile headphones sooner. Best upgrade I've made in years."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Okay so I started researching headphones a while ago and being new to the whole \"how much for those cans??!!\" market, I was sceptical of how much of a difference they would make and nervous about which ones to get.\nShort review line is, these are excellent. Job done, you can go now.\nNot satisfied? Well I've tested them out against my 5.1 Logitech z906 speakers which are running on an optical connection (worth noting that the DT990s are running from a Creative Labs G5 dac). In games the bass on the headphones is incredible. Cannon fire in World of Warships woke me up and not because it was loud but just because I'd never heard such a boom before. I've also been testing this on music (not an audiophile so bear with me here) and having just ran Masterchef Synesthesiaby by Swede Mason through both, one after the other, the sound was distinctive. I get why people say these cans aren't for bass heads after this test, not that it's from a lack of bass on the cans but because it's airy. The speakers delivered a wall of sound which I felt as much as heard and the result was the bass was powerful but messy. I couldn't tell one bass line from another. With the DT990s I can tell which bass line is doing what without any effort whatsoever but it doesn't assault my head with a rumble designed to make soup of my brain (that's both an advantage and a disadvantage in my book). I can say however that the bass isn't lacking. Spread Your Love doesn't have quite the dirty bass I'm used to. Keine Lust comes through nice and punchy (as I've just found out, ensure you have that dac set to direct audio or you're wasting the potential of these cans) but unlike most headphones, iems and speakers I've tried this track on, I can separate the guitars perfectly, even in the busy chorus.\nNow, for build quality, these feel excellent. I've broken many headsets in my time and the only ones to last have been a pair of Sennheiser PC323Ds which these DT990s are replacing. I've got confidence that these cans will last a good long while. They're solid and feel like they're going to be heavy but really aren't when they're on your head. As for fit, I have an inordinately large cranium (stop giggling!) and they fit fine. Firm clamping force fresh out of the box. Nothing uncomfortable. Does feel a little warm around my head but I'm more of a cold weather guy and it's been up to 26c in front of my pc the last couple of nights so I'm putting it down to that.\nAccessories wise, you get the necessary and no more. The jack adaptor seems robust and well made (the threads on the screw joint into the 3.5mm work fine, which is usually the test of a decent engineer), the bag is nothing special and there's nothing else in the box.\nIf you like rock music from System of a Down to AC/DC and Queen Adreena, I'd say you can buy with confidence.\nAs a parting note, I'm listening to Midlife Crysis by Faith no More as I write this and not only am I finding new pieces of the music that I can enjoy, the bass is there like I've never heard before. It's no longer a background of continual growl without much rhythm but specific notes!\nI am very impressed with these cans (as you can probably tell). Now all I'm left wondering at is what you'd get for the £2k cans and above? If this is the lower end of the range then call me a philistine and leave me happy here."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought these on January 12th 2018 and it's now March 29th 2018, so I've had about two and a half months of continual use (most evenings for one to three hours, and then most weekends all day.... I game a lot...)\nI had done my research and had settled on these DT990s due to reputable brand, price, reviews etc but was still worried about how much noise the open back would let in while gaming. I knew the sound stage was much larger and would hopefully give me a bit of an advantage in games, but I worried the outside noise like cars and planes would void that - I was thankfully wrong. The open back doesn't let in nearly as much noise as I thought it would, but it's just enough to stop me from shouting (I used to shout a lot because I couldn't hear myself while wearing my old \n )\nThe only issue I had with these was how tight they sat on my head. I have a tiny head and the clamped really hard above my ears and caused a bit of pain. It took quite a bit of use for them to finally loosen up and now I don't have any pain or clamping - don't remember how long it took for them to settle and form to my head though.\nOverall? Love these. Glad I bought them Music sounds great - can hear more in games - and they're just an overall nice set of cans."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Fantastic sound quality, terrible head band.\nFor reference my current setup is running the headphones through the headphone amp on my Soundblaster ZxR. I have a pair of AKG K550 which are good quality but very flat. I also own a couple of pairs of Sennheiser headsets: The 360 and the game one, both have pretty good sound quality but are still a bit flat, although not nearly as much as the AKG K550. All 3 sets pale in comparison to the Beyer 990s for films, music and games.\nThe bass and treble are both excellently reproduced with these headphones. If you are watching a film you might find yourself looking around the room when a truck goes past as the depth of the bass is so good, but not at all overpowering. Likewise the treble is very snappy and harsh sounds like bullets snapping by soldiers and tires screeching sound as unpleasant as they would in the flesh.\nIt's also quite impressive how they will pick out a lof of the ambient noises in TV and film so you can hear bits of background conversations that would normally just sound like noise.\nIn terms of music genres I listen to rock, metal, hip hop, drum and bass and most likely a few genres I can't think of right now. The Beyers work well in all of them and I'm genuinely surprised at being able to hear so much additional detail when none of my previous headphones/headsets were exactly cheap or bad. It's worth noting that these headphones are not overly bassy like some other headphones I can think of that are apparently popular because an artist put his name on them and added some metal weights so they feel \"expensive\"\nSadly the headband is made of either real or fake leather that bunches ever so slightly due to the bend of the headband and digs into your head. I don't know why Beyer didn't use the microfibre type material the ear cups are made of as that's really comfortable and works very well on other sets of headphones I own.\nI'm currently looking at making my own head band strip as the current one starts to become quite unpleasant after a couple of hours of wear. I'd say it is really inexcusable for headphones costing this much to have such a band headband and if the sound quality wasn't so impressive I would have sent them back.\nIt's also worth noting that the headband suffers from falling apart from moisture after a year or so, it's discussed a lot online and would explain why a replacement is so readily available. Shame Beyer don't sell a replacement made out of comfortable material."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"From my amateur perspective, one of the best headphones i've had on my head. Im using them paired with Fiio E10k. I still prefer listening music on mine M100's purely for their more fun sound signature, but those are MUCH more comfortable for long gaming sessions - ears can breath freely and You can hear Your surroundings, which may be good or bad. Sound on 990's is very clear and airy, with wide soundstage, but not exhausting - i've heard many opinions that those have ear piercing trebles, but must disagree. Treble is indeed highlighted, but not overbearing. Sound signature feels much more natural compared to V-moda M100's, and much more detailed despite less condensed soundstage (compared to closed headphones) Bass obviously lack compared to closed construction, BUT is still present and its very satisfying. In fact its impressive bass considering their much wider soundstage and more detailed sound, just not as prominent as on M100's.  Build quality is excellent, those legends about german engineering are not joke! Frame is made from metal, cups have high quality plastic, and pads feels like cut down clouds. Really, i've never felt so much comfort wearing headphones. Clamping force is less than on M100's but still good enough to stay on my head. In conclusion, im in love with those, overall best headphones i've ever had, and dont plan to change for many, many years."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"These headphones are good. They sound crystal clear and are very comfortable to wear.\nAs you can see from the photos that the logo part that is on the cups is loose and begins to peel off. I've push them in and they push back out a few hours after. It's looks like I will have to glue them in place.\nWhich is kind of a let down given the price of the headphones. Also it only comes with one set of ear pads (the velvet/non leather ones), just wanted to let people know."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Even though they feel a bit light & cheap to begin with, you soon realise it's to give you extended listening pleasure without weight-fatigue. They are open-backed so expect some leakage. I wouldn't wear these on public transport as you'll wind-up the person sitting next to you. Super-long cable so I can use these on the AV Receiver if the missus is on her mobile while i'm watching another 'S*** SciFi film' (sic). Excellent sound stage with a flat response. I wear glasses and they don't press against them at all!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Amongst the very best in the world. Sound is neutral detailed lively. Not suitable for use in crowded places (get 770 for that or the amazing DT 235 or DT231). I use them for movies, straight out of a Mini Mac without amp, it's immersive and beats the heck out of almost every speaker in the world. 250 ohm hard to drive loud for laptops and phones."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Things I like: Very neutral and great separation and soundstage. Similar to áth m50 in sound. Very comfortable to wear for long periods, really like the ear cups material. Not sweaty at all due to the open backed nature. Also while an amp might be nice to use with these, it isn't strictly required, they do work without one while you save up to buy one.\nThings I didn't like : the headphone themselves feel kind of shoddy. While light and comfortable to wear the metal going into the headband has a lot of play in it and does not inspire confidence in the longevity of the product. The cable is really long, good for some set ups but for me it tends to get in the way quite a bit. Also it's not braided, something that I would happily have paid extra for in a \"special\" edition."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These headphones are incredible, I got them for gaming as I play a lot of PUBG(Player Unknown Battle Grounds) which requires you to hear exactly where a shot is coming from, the sound of footsteps, the banging noises from movement above you and the sound of reloading a gun with the accuracy of these headphones I am always able to tell where people are from the sound. Would definitely recommend to buy.\nThey are also incredible with music as I have noticed I can hear the guitar strings being pulled and strummed with more details.\nThese headphones are a little uncomfortable at first but after a month they wear in so they are then comfy, alternatively you can get a stand that you leave them on whilst you are out to wear them in and now they are super comfortable.\nThe open section as well also allows for you to hear perfectly what anyone's saying to you as well as listen to the game or music."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro LE Black Edition:\nSolid build, not too heavy, crystal clear sound (although on the quiet side) & I do believe the open-back & semi-open-back ear monitors will always be superior in sound quality no matter what any amateurish fool may tell you! The 250Ohm Drivers are quite precise, the low end isn't oversaturated & in fact, at least acoustically is incredibly precise, all the way down to 35/40hz you'll still get a great clean & clear response, treat these ear monitors with care & you'll experience little to no phasing even after a good couple of years of almost daily use...\n8/10 Overall a great pair of ear monitors, fit for precision editing in low med & high frequencies, also suitable for mixing & mastering 👌"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I have heard these cans described as very analytical, which is partly true. The bass is precise and very responsive (perfect for a funky bassline, jazz & classical music) but it isn't going to make your eyeballs rattle in their sockets ...so if you enjoy floor-shaking EDM or are after a gaming headset that does a hellfire justice, perhaps look elsewhere. The top end is really crisp, best appreciated when listening to acoustic tracks: the pluck of every guitar string is placed delightfully right into the centre of your head. This combination of a crisp top and a detailed, unoffensive bass gives the cans a wide, 'analytical' sound that is energetic and enjoyable in its own right. However, the middle is somewhat lacking and (if you have an amp) you may find yourself cranking up the volume to interrogate subtleties in the body of the sound. You can keep climbing the dB and these headphones will give you more and more, but you may end up confronting eardrum-piercing high frequencies before you get to the meaty middle that you so desire, depending on your taste. If you're looking for analytical phones in terms of a flatter, more faithful frequency response curve, these aren't perfect out-of-the-box ...but the combination of Sonarworks True-Fi + Schiit Fulla 2 tames these DT 990s very nicely (and I'd rather tame a sparkling but overenthusiastic pair like these rather than try to force energy and detail into a boring but flat pair).\nAt 250 Ohm they *can* be driven adequately from my laptop or S8 so, assuming you aren't particularly hard of hearing, you don't *have* to have an amp to enjoy these. They're nicely built and have a tight, serious but not uncomfortable fit. Straight into the laptop/hi-fi these headphones sound like they're worth twice the amount they cost. With equalisation and a decent DAC/amp, these become disproportionately enjoyably at the price point."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great sound , enough said... do your research\nThis product is everything I expected.\nOnly down side .. for long periods of use the headband does get sore.. I'm talk 5 hours plus.\nSomething to be aware of ... but sound quality is lovely. Get a amp"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These headphones are simply amazing, I use them for gaming and the accuracy of footsteps around you is superb. Most people have been saying an astro mixamp( i have the 250ohm version dt990s) wont be enough to power these but if you max out both volume dials it definitely is not just loud enough but actually loud. 10/10 would highly recommend to every gamer, I had the hyperx cloud alpha before these and even though those are great, they are nothing in comparison to these. There is a thick bass for an open back headphone which I was super surprised about and the treble may be a SMALL bit too pronounced right out of the box but once you break on the drivers with about 100 hours of playtime they sound like an absolute dream. They have literally the perfect soundstage for gaming."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Lovely headphones.\nGot them to replace an ageing pair of Senny HD598 cans and the difference is very noticable. I've been using them for about 2 months now.\nThe bass is present, without being overpowering. The treble seemed a little harsh at first but seemed to cool down very quickly. The soundstage is excellent making these great for gaming.\nThe headband did seem a little tight at first, especially as I have a rather large head but again they've loosened up a lot and now they're very comfortable, this is while wearing glasses.\nThe only real gripe I have with them is the lack of a replaceable cable. Other than that I have no complaints at all.\nI'd certainly recommend to anyone looking to give their ears a treat."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Oh my god. Where do I start with these? I have the HD579s from Sennheiser, and I always find myself picking up the Beyers instead. The music feels alive in them, the detail, the clarity. I gave them time to burn in for a little, and they sound just amazing. I use them with my PC on an external DAC and for home listening on my LG V30, the latter can power them no problem. What an amazing piece of audio hardware, in short words. New favourites."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Im no ear expert but these sound amazing. Replaced some old cans i had and could immediately tell the difference. Listened to Octopath soundtrack and could hear the flute player breathe in !! And that was on MP3 !!!!

These headphones are very honest, so don't buy them if you're looking for that bang-for-bass sound that most popular brands (Beats & Bose) give you. This is one for the audiophiles!
