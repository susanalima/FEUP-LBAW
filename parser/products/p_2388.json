My music  tastes are wide ranging to say the least, and the K271s have been 'tested' on music which included Joe Strummer & The Mescaleros, Joni Mitchell, Ben Webster, Lou Reed, John Martyn and Jacqueline du Pré ... a fair selection I feel.\nAs said, they invariably deliver pleasing and engaging music quality and although the sound stage may not be as precise as my old HD540 Reference Pros, they represent very good value indeed - I have a feeling I will be trawling through my music collection yet again and enjoying every minute of it through the K271s .... :)"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"solid and nicely isolated due to their closed back nature, these headphones are ideal for my uses, they are solely used as my drumming headphones, so I can jam along to my songs without having to play my music too loudly, and stopping me going deaf from my drum kit too. Although when drumming I do not really get the whole benefit of the AKG sound quality, I have tried them running off my PC with a little dot mk 2 tube amp, and have to say the quality is nearly as good as my AKG K702s I use for playing games, and listening to music on primarily (although due to the closed nature of the k271s I am reviewing here, the sound stage is more compressed.\nFor prolonged use these headphones are comfy, and will enclose my ears instead of partially trapping them, even with my glasses on. I consider my ears relatively average size, so would like to think this would be the case for most people, but it's worth trying them if possible. They are very secure in my head, I wouldn't say tight, but hold enough that I can play like a madman on my drums and headbang along without them falling off - which would lead me to think that if they do sit over part of your ear they would get uncomfortable with long periods of wearing.\nThe cans come with a nice long cable, with your 3.5 audio jack as standard for mp3 players and phones, and a screw in larger phono adaptor for plugging into most other things, including some guitar amps, or my other electric drums =).\n  In my opinion a very good set of cans for the price, and I would definitely recommend to drummers or other musicians due to their isolation, and nice long, sturdy cable and option of phono or standard 3.5 jack. A high recommendation from me."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I've owned the first version of these over-ear headphones for more than a decade and they've lasted that long with heavy use. I also have the Sennheiser HD650, HD25 and B&O H6. I would rank these just below the H6 overall but the H6 is much pricier and not quite as comfortable as these.\nThe good: The cord is replaceable and long. The headphones mute when you take them off (genius). Super comfortable with the velour pads, big cups and flexible headband. Super robust. The sound quality is good enough. Isolation is excellent and others will be protected from your music.\nThe meh: The sound quality is good enough. You can get better sound with open headphones and more expensive closed headphones, but you will be hard-pressed to find the same all-day comfort.\nThe bad: These are not for the fashion conscious. I bought them for a relative who found them bulky and weird but four years later she still wears them while using her computer. That's because of their amazing comfort. They couldn't be fashionable headphones without sacrificing what makes them great. Don't wear them walking around in public as you look like a spaceman with them on."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"AKG's have always been renown for quality, I work in recording studios and owned many pairs by this manufacturer.  These are not manufactured in Austria anymore they are made in China, there is a slight but not at first glance difference.\nThe reason for the 3 stars is\n1. AKG selling point is not only sound quality, but comfort and for every pair of AKGs Ive owned (other than these) I can concur  that even after a twelve hour stint there is no comfort issue and the quality of sound has always been good.  Weather its been with a low or high priced pair.\nThese on the other hand are very uncomfortable,  the provided ear pad are tiny,  I have small ears and they just fit, the head band is too tight - makes you feel like your head is in a vice. the actual driver is way too close to your ear and it gets very hot, you've got to take them off after 20 mins.  Ive put some pads on from an old pair of AKGs and they for me more comfortable.\n2. The Mute does not always work.\n3 Sound quality wise,  I find them no better than e.g. the K92 which are far less money and very comfortable.  This is just my personal opinion, if you compare the two on paper the k271 have a slightly wider dynamic range. However paper can hear.\nOn the plus side, the mini XLR and two different cables for me are a welcome addition, In a studio environment it is easy to get headphone cables caught up in chair wheels and break the cable and have to bin a good pair of headphones.\nThere is no sound leak,  A quick example, if Im wearing the K271s and turn a power amp to full volume and blast some sound out of monitors I cant hear it."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Bought these for use with an electronic drum kit and as an upgrade from the AKG K44 that I normally use. I really wanted to love these headphones but I was really disappointed with the audio quality and their lack of ability to deal with low end. They would clip at the slightest hint of kick drum to the point where I thought they must've arrived damaged. Compared to the K44, they seemed to have nowhere near the level of volume handling... which was a real shame as I liked the look, comfort and features... but in the end, I had to return them as simply not fit for purpose. I really hope I had a duff pair..."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Very comfortable with a nice clamp (coming from a senn head-vice user), especially so with the velour pads. Fairly neutral sound, slight emphasis on higher vocal region. Very open sounding even when compared to similarly priced open-backs. Fits very well with piano but not recommended for a bass-head or most southern rock.\nThese 'will' feel a touch tacky / toy like if you are used to higher end headphones and lack the deep end impact I was expecting compared to some other closed-backs. Material-wise they are quite light and the plastic feels very thin unlike higher spec'd nylon/polymer. Be aware this is reflected in the soundstage. Almost a four but not quite."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"These headphones produce a very clear and true sound, however they are let down by their quality. Unfortunately after around 2 years of use the piece of plastic that holds the elastic thing that presses switch broke. Quickly after sound stopped coming out of one ear, I took the headphones apart and realised the plastic bracket that holds both the metal headpieces (which act as conductors to transfer sounds from one ear to the other) in place had distorted and broken, which pulled away from the wires connected to the drivers and broke the solder joint."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I did purchase at around the same price, a so called \"Monitor\" set of headphones.  I found them to be very bass heavy and problems with the cable connections.  They were not what I would regard as \"monitor\" quality, they were returned.  From reading various reviews, I selected the AKG.271 headphones.  I am delighted with them.  To me, they have a very natural sound and that is what I was looking for.  In addition, I like the auto switch that turns off the sound when you remove the headphones.  The closed back is also a good feature.  I find them comfortable to wear, even in hot weather for over an hour."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I spent a fair amount of time deciding upon this purchase.  I could very easily have purchased a set of Grados or Beyerdynamics, either of which would (I am sure) have been nice.  However, I decided upon these AKGs and I am very pleased that I did.\nIn this age of disappointing overtly plastic products, I had been concerned that build quality would suffer.  Whilst these are still a very cheap set of headphones, the build quality is pretty good.  They certainly feel robust - the separate lead is a real bonus in this respect.  They are also very comfortable.  The sound reproduction is good - with catholic tastes in the past three weeks I've listened to pop, noise pop, hard bop, alt-country, sacred and classical music, and been very pleased with the reproduction.\nRecommended."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"My Sennheiser 565 Ovations, considered to be a standard for neutrality and detail are now 17 years old. I was recently in the British Library doing an online course, and the library uses AKG 271 studio headphones on all of their computers. I was so impressed with the sound quality that I ordered a pair online. I use them at home with a Meridian 203 DAC and an NAD 3020i audio amplifier, through the  headphone socket.  They are definitely in the same class as the Sennheisers. The bass,  using the supplied velour earpads is rich, tight and deep, the midrange,while being less full than the Sennheisers, is crisp and incisive. This slight leanness in the lower mid might well  contribute to the impression that they are slightly tighter than the Senheisers. The treble, however is very bright indeed, and reveals all the detail in a recording, warts and all. It can give the impression , of being slightly disorganised particularly with rock music. but this quality is largely benign and not intrusive. They also create a good sense of space,considering that they are closed-back headphones, and image well too, which seems to be largely down to the bright, incisive treble. They are well- built and do not give the impression of being fragile unlike the Sennheisers. Comfort is good, although I have not yet used them  for many hours at a stretch. All in all a good buy and likely to last me for many years. With their occasionally ruthless exposure of fine detail, they may perhaps not be to everybody's taste, particularly if you like a warm,rich sound, however the bass is cetainly rich enough to avoid these cans sounding \"cold\" and has god punch and detail, too. I would recommend them to anybody who likes a bright, tight revealing, yet easy- to- listen- to sound."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Very disappointing, so much so I initially wondered if these were fake.\nCheap feeling/looking and, most importantly, with abysmal sound reproduction, over accentuated highs and non-existent lows, they're certainly not fit for purpose in a monitoring/studio situation.\nSave more and opt instead for the Beyerdynamic range (DT770, 880, 990). The difference is night and day.\n70 quid wasted as these will gather dust in a drawer somewhere!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"i have both these and the audiotechnica m50x, and these are infinitely better sounding, and way more confortable. Only downside is that the AT achieve a higher volume with a portable device, but on a laptop this difference disappears. Want to compare with the behringer in the future"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Weirdly long lead. Blocks out lot of the noise in the office. Nice they turn off when not being worn. Comfortable to wear all day."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Bought as a replacement for Koss Porta Pro for everyday use. They are not built as a tank is, but I took mine on a 4 months hitchhiking journey on South America. They were thrown inside a my bag all the way, endured all the trip providing quality music, and still to this day they are almost intact, aside from some cosmetic scratches.\nMost people in my office ask why I bought this instead of the apple brand, but then I show them the sound quality and they rant :)"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I thought I had some reference headphones until I bought these. I can hear production nuances I never heard before on tracks I'm very familiar with. They are absolutely superb and now really affordable. Build quality is fine, and I could wear them all day."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Big mistake buying these headphones, certainly not suitable for General use with a high end amp and cd player,very flat neutral sound,tried with phone and tablet with spotify,still very flat. won't recommend these to any one,maybe suitable for studio or other use."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"V. Good"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These are perfect for mixing and monitoring. The cup of the earpiece cuts out any interference and the drivers are tight and punchy. Auto cutout is also an advantage when switching to speakers so you don't get any HF bleed from the headphones."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great middle of the road monitoring for a decent price. They are comfortable for long sessions and the mute feature is nice. Frequency response isn't quite as flat as I'd like as there seem to be some resonances in the mid range. Still can't argue for the price though, hopefully I'll get some HD650's one day :/"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Superb headphones bought for working on fine detail on studio mixes. Very smooth and flat, and therefore realistic, audio reproduction across the entire spectrum no noticeable emphasis. Usually I always get the bass end wrong when mixing on headphones but not with these! very pleased!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great headphones, wonderful for mixing, with excellent responses. Dynamic range is extraordinary and adds little colour to the audio enabling a truer mix. Brilliant for the average music listener, excellent quality. AKG All the way for me!! 10/10"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great product"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Very good headphones. High quality."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Bought these along with a FiiO E10 USB DAC/amp and am completely satisfied. Maybe they don't hit the lowest of the low in the bass register but what you hear is nice and punchy. Works well with my Onkyo TX-SR875 receiver as well. Good fit, includes extra ear pads and two changeable cables so can't really think of any complaints."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Brilliant headphones.  Purchased for my husband who writes music.  No sound leakage and superior sound quality.  Would definitely purchase again.  Thank you"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"The headphones are nice. The sound is very very flat and thats not so bad. The only disappointing thing is that this model is made in China and feels a bit cheap compared to the previous K 271S."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Very good frequency response and not hyped at the bottom so they are good for mixing."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"They look mint ! And feel nice to ware ! They feel exspensive but the sound is just so tinny ... where's the bass????"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"great product. it sometimes mutes itself tho, I don't know why. restarts when I hit it :)"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"bought these largely guided by other reviews. the sound is pretty good although i think with hindsight i would get open ones. don't like the auto mute when you take them off which i only became aware of when it was too late, via another reviewer who also thought this a bad idea. he said his were already starting to give him problems. just another thing to
