I'm a professional video producer and these headphones work great, both in the edit suite and in the field. Bought after using the same model at work (for a big international news media organisation who swear by them) so have had a very long time to get to know the model.\nReplaceable lead is a BIG plus if your out shooting and they get knocked around alot. Sound quality is fantastic and noise cancellation good. they are VERY comfortable too, even if you wear glasses you can use them for an entire working day without a hint of discomfort. Finally price, I got a fantastic deal on open (in reality non-existent) box from amazon warehouse but the cans themselves were brand spanking new.\nIf your undecided between these and the audiotechnicas dont be. do yourself a favour and go for these."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"These were recommended by sound engineer Dave Rat and I bought them on the strength of that. I've been using Red5 Audio headphones for tracking and there was lots of bleed, particularly the metronome click in the studio. The Shures have fixed that problem.\nThey came with a stretchy old-style phone cable that's both useful and annoying. Useful obviously because of it's stretchy length, but annoying because of its weight, so it bounces around a bit when you're playing.\nI also use these for live mixing and they have good sound isolation for shaping your live sound coming out the mixer. I would buy them again, and may in fact do just that for my studio."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Really good headphones. I can hear detail in my mixes I really couldn't before. They take a bit of getting used to. I found I was putting too much bass on at first. I don't think they're exactly flat in response but that's tough to find at this price. I often mix with these at night and I don't have to tweak too much to get things to sound right on my monitors.\nThey're really well made and good value. The only criticism I have is it would have been useful if Shure packaged a straight cable with these alongside the curly one and they're a little bit heavy."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Got these at a ridiculously cheap price (£31 odd - not sure if it was a mistake!) and bought on an impulse to sit alongside all my other sets of headphones!\nThese are quality cans and despite reports are quite comfortable.\nSound is great with decent inputs - use mine with a SMAL M6 DAC and HiRes or normal FLAC tracks and am impressed.\nNot particularly portable - you'd look like a Cyberman on the train with these but perfect for home use - they are after all, studio monitors, not portable cans.\nGreat at the prive I got them for but would have to audition more to see if worth full price."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Probably the best headphones I've used in the last few years for the price they are simply stunning\nI've had £350 sennys sonys audio technica and bose amongst others, was never really happy one way or another but these for me are beautiful......  using on my 2011 i Mac and sometimes with my Sony USB dac they sound supreme wished I'd have gone for shure a long time ago"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These are the best headphones I've ever owned. In the past I've had problems with the cable failing (including on my Sennheiser HD 205) so this time I decided to buy a set with a detachable/replaceable cable.\nThe build quality of the headphones is excellent - the frame is strong and the hinges look like they will last. The cable is thick and tough and has a strong bayonet fitting to keep it connected to the headphones. They are very comfortable, although slightly heavy. I don't wear mine for toooo long at a time but I can see these being quite heavy if you wear them all day. I wore the SRH840 and SRH440 in a music shop before buying, and found the SRH840 to be significantly more comfortable.\nThe sound quality is incredible. I wasn't sure what to expect but they blew away the Sennheiser HD 205 that they replaced. I use them about 50/50 for listening to music for enjoyment, and editing/mixing music. They are great for both."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Wonderful sounding headphones. Recently my Audio Technica M50s broke, so I was in the market for some new closed back headphones which would be suitable for mixing and mastering but which would be good for listening on the train as well. I personally prefer these to the M50s, I highly recommend them!\nPros\n-------\n+Easy to drive, you don't really need a headphone amp.\n+Relatively balanced sound, less hyped bass and treble then the M50s although I wouldn't say they are completely flat sounding. Mid range is much more clear and it's easier to pick apart the different instruments in a mix.\n+Comfort. The M50s got painful to wear after a pretty short time. These do get hot on your ears after a while like any other closed back headphones, but the pads feel very nice.\n+Isolation is great, blocks out a lot of background noise.\n+Soundscape is extremely impressive for closed back cans.\n+Feel really nicely made. Sturdy.\nCons\n--------\n-Quite heavy, you don't forget these are on like you would with AKGs.\n-The coiled cable supplied with them is pretty short, I would've liked a longer straight cable in the box as well.\nOverall, these are great headphones which I would recommend over the very popular ATH M50X. If you like a punchier bass sound then the M50s will be more to your liking, but for mixing/mastering and listening to a lot of different styles of music, I'm sure you will love these."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I've listened to many consumer headphones around this price and the SRH840 is surely the best. There is literally no comparison if you want beautifully balanced sound for under £130\nFirst impressions were the design. These phones ooze quality. Nice matte plastic. Comfy leather or pleather ear cups (you get a spare set). A coiled cable to increase both resilience and prevent tangling. They've thought of pretty much everything. This however comes at a cost. These are big and somewhat heavy. They look a little silly on your head, but then again, if sound reproduction is your priority, this is a negated point. Secondly, the headband feels a little flimsy. It slightly twists, but then again, not worryingly so. You can also fold the headphones due to the reversible Dj design and store them in the supplied drawstring case. A hardcase might have been a better choice, but it's adequate.\nRegarding the sound, everything I've listened to sounds different. Now by no means is my Onkyo 22-HDX bad at sound reproduction. But with the 840's I can pick out nearly every instrument in a song. There is no mish mash of sounds. There is no overpowering bass or drum track. Every instrument gets it's own recognition here. But not at the expense of the overall sound. This said, the headphones cope comfortably with classic, to rock and pop. The high's perhaps could be a little better, but the mid and low range are fantastic. You will enjoy listening to all your music again and appreciating stuff you never though you'd heard before, but was always there.\nThere are a few drawbacks to mention. Certain tracks like the Narratives \"Fade\" have a section with some harsh guitar electric strumming (not really sure what to call it). This sounds okay with normal headphones/speaker as it blends into the track. However it can really stand out on these headphones to the point it's painful. The same carries over to the quality of the music you listen to. 128kbps rips are easily identifiable, as are poorly encoded/transcoded files up to 320kbps. Additionally they are good at passively blocking out noise but suffer from being a little tight after a few hours.\nIn conclusion, whilst I listed quite a few drawbacks, these do not in any way detract from the sound quality. Quite simply, if you are looking at Monster Beats for instance, these are not for you. These are the inverse of what those phones represent.\nQuality Sound and Value for Money is here in spades."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"£91  and the first one sent had faulty sound and now the replacement a mere 6 months later has snapped broken at its supposed thickest part where its supposed to flip open and shut. This has to be the worst set of headphones i have ever owned and at this price this is bloody outrageous, and since ive had it repalced once already im stuck now with headphones i cant replace or repair. I wonder how many out there dont even bother posting their problems, WATCH OUT get another brand. t was broken and now the replacement a mere 6 months later has snapped broken at its supposed thickest part.

I wonder how many out there dont even bother posting their problems, WATCH OUT get another brand."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I've had these for many months now, and there was a couple of quality control issues lowering my score.\nFirst is the cable, I bought a new one about a month ago because this curly mess broke, I left a separate review for the replacement.\nSecondly the tiny thin cables that come out of the speakers and then into the headband was kinked when they arrived. It was a matter of time before this kink meant they split. It's not as easy to mend as normal cables because it's so thin, you have to melt the protective sheet off the individual cables because you cannot strip it.\nThe reason it got 3 stars is the quality of the audio itself is fine and the comfort is fine, except my right ear hurts when I use them too long. I would not buy these if you had the money."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Excellent headphones.superb detailed sound quality and natural bass.tried a couple of well known German brands with dissapointing results before I saw the shure ones.they are a bargain,well made and weighty with a quality finish.suited to all types of music.exile on main street sounds amazing on these phones as it let,s you hear everything in the messy mix.l love these headphones!"},{"rating":"2.0","content":"I wish I knew before. There are many posts on the web about the headband of this model being very low quality plastic. Normal use, I do 1 Skype call per day and listen to music in the office.\nNext time I'll buy one with metal headband.\nIt is a pity because I did really liked the sound and the isolation."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Amazing sound. These are brilliantly sounding headphones and comfortable too.\nFor such great headphones and from such a great manufacturer, the only let down is the really naff flimsy case. Such headphones should come as standard with a hard case!!!"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Bought these just for a casual set of headphones but had to return as the headband was very small, i had to ware them fully extended and were still tight."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Very good headphones. I've owned them for more than three months now and I am more than happy with my choice. The sound quality is excellent. The only headphones I heard in the same price range were the AKG K271 II and they sounded thinner than the Shures.\nThere are two things though that I do not like about these headphones. First and most important in my opinion is the wire between the headphones which is exposed between the headband and the headphone and if you are not careful you might damage it. The second is that the headphones are pretty heavy if you are not used to wearing headphones. Don't get me wrong, they are comfortable to wear but if you're not used to wearing headphones and are wearing these for more than an hour your head might start to hurt.\nThat said they are definitely worth buying. As I said the sound quality is excellent, across all spectrum. You need to break them in for a while - their sound gets better as you use them. You are most likely need a headphone amplifier to get the most out of them. They will sound acceptably loud with a portable music player but it's likely that you're gonna need more than that. I use them together with a Fiio E17 DAC/headphone amplifier and it's a wonderful experience. The headphones are very revealing and I am constantly discovering new things in old songs, things that I had no idea were in the recording. The feeling is priceless. :) The downside of this is that there will be a lot of mp3s that you won't like listening to anymore. You'll start hearing how bad they actually are.\nI connected the headphones through the Fiio to a M-Audio Delta 1010LT  and I could feel the difference from the Fiio's own DAC. So I'm guessing that with a better amplifier and with better DACs these headphones can sound even better.\nA nice thing to add to these headphones would be the velour pads ( http://www.amazon.com/Shure-HPAEC940-Replacement-Velour-Headphones/dp/B005OM06RG/ ) which unfortunately don't seem to be sold in Europe. They are advertised as an accessory for the next headphones in Shure's lineup, the SRH940 but I read they fit perfectly on the 840s.\nI read a lot of reviews before buying these headphones and they were an overall winner in all comparative reviews, within their price range of course. So if you're looking for the best in this price range go ahead and buy them."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Fast delivery and very good quality service, and what about the product...
