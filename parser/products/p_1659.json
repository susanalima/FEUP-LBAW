Right OK so we got that? OK...the thing about these cans is that they cost a paltry £40.\nWhat these headphones show is that OneOdio has access to many (if not all) of the internal components that all of the various vendors use, package and tune in various different ways, with varying degrees of build quality and finish.\nThe drivers in these headphones are really quite good. The sound is pretty balanced, full and clean. Treble is not splashy, bass is not overblown and the midrange is not dulled down to create the illusion of \"premium sound quality\". Do they sound as good as the VModas or Shure's mentioned just now, well, no of course they don't, but then you are paying less than half to one fifth of what those can cost. Do they sound only half or only one fifth as good...no they do much better than this...but then we are into the law of diminishing return territory. That being said they still perform (audibly at least) ahead of their price tag.\nAlthough these are closed back they are not the best at shutting out exterior noise. If that is an absolute priority for you then you may want to look elsewhere. The sound signature is that of a closed back headphone but not to the detriment of a sense of space around the track - so again an indication that the drivers are tuned pretty well against the packaging.\nThe packaging of the drivers is perhaps slightly less impressive. I know where I would rather have the money spent by OneOdio though. The enclosures are pretty solid if a little plasticky (so what). The ear pads are soft enough and thick and the headband is pretty well put together and sturdy. The adjustment is a little scratchy and after long periods of wearing you do know you have them on as they fit quite snuggly and are ever so slightly on the heavy side.\nThe removable cable to either a STANDARD 3.5mm or 6.5mm jack (one on each can) is just superb. None of your proprietary plugs or recessed jacks here. So you can use your own cable and mic or instal a VModa microphone (why I bought them) or daisy-chain two pairs of these together - so well done for the flexibility.\nPlay some good quality audio through these and they will do better then their price tag. Plug them into a headphone amp and play some uncompressed or Hi-Res audio and you will be patting yourself on the back that you spent just £40 on them. Detail resolution, timing, balance, bass detail and depth are all on point.\nOh and yes they do sound better than absolutely any Bluetooth headphones or buds I have heard so far - which for my money are still not up to even modest performance levels of wired cans with a semi respectable source fed to them."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I was hoping for a good headphone since my exclusive Bose earpads broked. I did call for to get new pads and it would have cost me the same amount as these headphones did. So here I am enjoying my new OneOdio and they do a BETTER job when I am mixing my new songs. Very Pleased and I must say it was a quick delivery too. // Thank you from SecondTony"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"The sound from these headphones is really good in terms of clarity and depth, the source of the sound does not come from between your ears but as if it was  originating in front and around you. Good bass and  audio frequency response Excellent value for money spent."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Very comfortable on my ears. Nice padding. Have weight to them but I wouldn't say they're heavy. The wire is very thick and long (no homo) and has an elastic bit so you can connect them to your PC from quite a far distance. Delicious headphones 5/5 for the price."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Bought these as I play guitar and needed some comfortable phones with a long lead. The usual length was just to short and keep falling off and pulling the amp when ever I moved. These are great, comfortable and light enough to wear for a practise session. Great sound and the long cable makes them useful."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I don't use these professionally so can only comment on these headphones on a like for like against comparable headphones at this price point.  The brief I was given was to find headphones that are comfortable to wear, over ear and with good sound quality for listening to music and watching movies.  These are over qualified for this use, very comfortable, comes with carry bag and two leads with different adaptors (allowing more than one input).  They can be daisy chained with another set of headphones (any make).  They are fantastic for the money!!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These headphones are comfy to wear and give very good, neutral sound. Nothing bad stands out, such as over bright treble or boomy bass. Excellent midrange for vocals. There is very good soundstaging for a closed back design. Resolution is quite good too. Althouth plastic they seem quite well built and are quite quiet when moving my head around. Choice of cable plug size is interesting but not of use to me personally. The pads are large but the hole is only 5cm in length, which is about 1cm smaller than the average adult ear, so these sit on, not over, my ears. Other than being a bit hot after a couple of hours listening that's no problem. I don't know why so many reviewers mention a battery as it doesn't use one. Excellent value."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I have changed my usual headphones for this ones as the style looks very cool and retro too. They are a big small for my ears but they are comfortable to wear, you can even fold them in case you want to put the in your bag. This headphones are supposed to be excelent for music people that work in music studios so sound quality should be amazing, in my case Inthink it’s good but not excellent maybe because I have not used both connecting cables but i don’t think that’s the reason. from my point of view the price is okay because you pay for something that is good quality and looks and feels good material and well built. Bare in mine this headphones are NOT wireless/bluetooth so you will always need a connection cable to listen to the music!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I'm so happy with these, I primarily bought these for my DJ setup but I've found myself using them for so much more (listening to music, mixing music gaming and for the tv)\nThe build quality and sound quality is excellent, the bass is nice and deep but tight and the treble is nice and clear and they are very loud.\nThey are also comfortable and not heavy at all so can be worn for long periods.\nThey also came with multiple leads all of which are gold contact and feel like really good quality cable aswell as a charger cable and carry pouch\nExcellent value for money in my opinion and I would definitely recommend them."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"The headphones come with all necessary cables to use for all their features and the soft lining storage bag.\nI like listening to the music through the pair of good headphones and these are not exception, but none of the other pair I've used had an option to share the music with another pair of headphones or another device thanks to its dual purpose cables. The sound quality in them is just amazing, very clear and reach in bass. They are very comfortable too due to the large soft ear pads cushions and soft head band. I always choose the oval shape as it much more comfortable for the ears and better passive noise cancelling. The Bluetooth connection is stable and reliable and the battery lasts me nearly two weeks with 1-2 hours of use daily. It is also good to have the piece of mind when if the battery dies I can use them on cable."},{"rating":"5.0","content":" Thanks to the modern design the headphones suits to boys and girls and are appropriate for young and old people. The foldable property makes it very easy to store, pack and wear them. This makes a huge difference between this high quality product and others on the marketplace.\nI am very happy because i don't need any more adapters to carry after me thanks to the dual-duty cable when I share with my girlfriend my favourite music. Talking about cables, I don't need them because they are bluetooth aswell.\nRelated to the sound quality, it feels like I am in a Cinema. Hear every detail and deliver a professional quality sound.\nIt looks like this product it worth every penny."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Excellent well rounded sound. I looked at lots of reviews before purchasing. Great value for 49.99.\nOut of the box I was already impressed with what they look like. Charged it and I’m happy with the balanced sound quality. Very nice high and mid range sound. Base is about right for my taste, not overpowering, balanced. Battery charged in about 4 hours, and I have had it on for 20 hours now, still hasn't died.\nEar cups are a good size of soft high quality material which allows the headphones to sit nicely on your ears without causing discomfort. Build quality feels good and they’re not heavy."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"First time using wireless noise canceling headphones and having using them everyday since i purchased them, i must say im really impressed with the quality and the battery life of these headphones. The build quality is really good and the sound quality is just as amazing. The headphones are comfortable to wear and are very compact which makes them easy to pack into your bag when commuting. I woupd highly recommend these to anyone who is an adement music listener our anyone after a good pair of headphones. The noise cancelling is also very impressive and works a charm when You need it."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This headphone is a perfect item to replace any of those high end headphones. Firstly, the design looks sleek; the all black colour with tints of metallic looks give this a high quality feel. Wearing the headphone is very comfortable even for a long use, probably because it is padded very well. The sound quality is very impressive; you get the nice deep bass as well as the surround sound effect which I didn't expect from a headphone of this budget. The noise cancelling is fairly decent too; not the best obviously, but better than what I would have imagined. It comes with a carry bag which also looks and feels amazing!"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"If you dont want to read my rather long review, my summary is that these are nearly perfect if not for their insane sound leakage.\n- great quality sound (9/10)\n- loud volume (10/10)\n- comfortable on the top of you head (7-8/10)\n- comfortable on ears (8-9/10)\n- noise cancelling (8/10) - they arent actually 'active' noise cancelling, but are passive noice cancelling. of course you will always hear whats going on outside as with any $300 pair, but they block out background noise in general\n- asthetics (7/10) - imo they dont look too trendy, but for the price thats no concern, and who gives a duck *quack* about appealling to the wider masses anyways eh?\nnoise leakage (0/10)\nnoise isolation (which is about cancelling external noises as much as possible and and reducing internal noise leakage as much as possible) - (4/10 - good enough cancellation, ridiculous leakage)\nso what's the problem? why am i returning them? because they dont have good noise isolation properties. 'noise isolation' is supposed to be: 1- about blocking out, or cancelling (whether actively or passively (these are passive)), outside noise as much as possible; and, 2- about reducing sound LEAKAGE. these headphones fail on this second point. I kid you not when plugged into my iphone 6 at max volume, they're literally like speakers (weak speakers but still so loud). For me, that's a problem as i have flatmates to consider and as I dont want to be that guy who plays his music so loudly late at night nor in public.\nIf such excessive sound leakage is not a problem for you, i highly recommend these headphones as their sound their quality, their comfort, and (clearly) their volume are all top level. dont even bother with $300 Bose or Sony or Beats, try out these bad boys they will blow your mind!\nHowever, if, like me, you want good quality loud headphones that isolate sounds (i.e. CANCEL external sounds and DON'T LEAK internal sounds) then look elsewhere. its as simply as that. Its weird to be sitting on a bus / in the tube with headphones loudly bursting out classical music which im trying to memorise for piano - imagine sitting in public while listening to chopin's 1st ballade in g minor (DUUUUUUUNNNNNN, DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN, DUN DUN DUN DUN, DUN DUN DUN DUN DUUUUNNNNNNNUUUUNNNNNNNNHHHH - if you know, you know. if you dont know, google it), too loud and you look weird.\nAlso, dont bite my head off, i know these are 'DJing' headphones and that leakage is not much of an issue for DJs as all they care about is having loud headphones that cancel outside sounds so they can hear their own music (i dont know mjuch about DJing). but 'isolation' means 1- cancelling external sounds as much as possible and 2- reducing internal sound leakage as much as possible, so my argument is justified."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I used these Headphones for 6 days after I received it! And I can say that in general the quality of the item is pretty good, very durable! Battery works for me 3-4 days( I used it 5 hours during the day), so it also good! And what about sound - it has nice basses and sounds clear, but it also depends on the quality of music you are listening! I could not check very well noise cancellation, bs it was quite in the room, but in general works great!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Straight out of box paired with phone and playing no hassle. Great sound quality bass and treble perfect. Controls tracks on phone and noise cancelling works great. Volume is limited to avoid ringing ears but they are still loud enough to drown out background noise anyway. Nice and comfy to wear basic controls left ear is noise cancelling on and off right ear is play (pair), next previous so no need to fumble around."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"For gaming on PS4, these headphones really work great. The aux cord has an in line microphone, and the end of the wire has a spring to prevent the likelihood of the wire tearing (nice touch), and microphone quality is good. The sound from these headphones for gaming is great. It is easy to hear what and where things are coming from within games, and the headphones make it very easy to feel immersed while gaming.\nThe sound quality is very good, especially when listening to music. I have been able to feel the bass rather than just hear it – this is something that surprised me when I first used these headphones. The sound is balanced well – when I play music, it does sound like the track has been bass boosted to extremes or doesn’t sound tinny at high frequencies. Everything sounds clean and balanced. Also, the noise cancelling is pretty good – most sounds from the outside are drowned out.\nThe quality and feel of the headphones are good. They have some weight to them but are not heavy. The padding is very thick, and the red stitches against the black is quite a subtle but nice touch.\nOverall I am very happy with the headphones, these will definitely be my daily drivers for gaming, music, travel, and even for phone calls for as long as possible. Also, definitely worth the price."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These Headphones do everything I need, give exceptional overall sound quality, very comfortable wearing over long periods, useful adapter free  cable, fairly good external noise isolation and nicely made, at a competitive price point.\nI own other headphones, including premium makes and Yenona, excel for adding the missing musical detail."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This headphone is great for good sound quality. Also they are well design for staying on the head and being adjustable. Jack lock system is my favourite but Bluetooth music sharing is the thing I really wanted . The pouch is really lovely and will help me to keep and carry my headphone. I was struggling with my previous headphones for not being comfortable over my head and ears but this one is perfect. And I love the whole design and package in my first impression."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"The sound quality is decent, but not too great; the bass is a bit too loud and I have to turn the volume up to fully enjoy my songs.\nThe main problem I’m having with this product is that it is slowly deteriorating simply by using it. There’s no rough play going on with the usage of my headphones, yet the headphone parts (which are attached to the headband and can rotate on their own) have become loose, making them hard to wear in the first place.\nOn top of that, once I do wear it, the comfort level of the headphones are teribble due to some sort of deformation that occurred within just a few months of use. It presses against the top of my head and now the actual headphone parts are slanted and slightly float above my ears on the bottom half, which is extremely unpleasant for more than 1-1.5 hours.\nAt the start, this headphone was okay; the comfort was acceptable and I could deal with the loud bass. However, if you are planning on buying a long-lasting headphone, I would not recommend buying this at all."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought these headphones in order to study in loud spaces. For the price tag, they certainly do their job. The noise canceling capabilities may not be able to block out all of the loudest sounds, but if you crank up the volume on them you won’t be disturbed by it outside noises. Excellent battery life, love the Bluetooth, would definitely buy again."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These headphones are truly amazing , best bass and lows and highs , honestly these i are the best pair of Bluetooth headphones I have ever owned. Very light weight and has a good fit so it doesn’t fall off. If your that person that commutes to work by walking bus or train , this I definitely for you. The sound is very punch it looks very stylish."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Daily go on a long walks and really enjoy the quality of the headphone, pair with my phone and use directly with amazing sounds, it’s very comfortable to wear for long time with excellent design, has size adjustable, and has decent noise isolating, overall the build quality is top and the sound quality is far better then expected."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"the long wire seemed to go faulty within 5 mins - but thankfully had something that would take its place,  The noise cancelling feature isn't that great - it's a little hit and miss, maybe that was due to the cable issue; but as they were then used in a recording scenario - there really wasn't much other noise about...."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"One of my best buys, this product is everything the description says it does. The comfort, background noise cancelling and it actually fits my head. IF you are reading this I recommend this product to anyone who is curious enough. If you are an editor, like myself, these shall benefit you in everyway possible. When the audio is too loud in Premiere these headphones make it so that you do not hurt your ears as much, which is very difficult to find in cheap products."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Lovely clear sound. Perfect for my needs as I play guitar plus cable is long enough when i do recording. Barely  noise leakage which is perfect for travelling going to work They're very light so no neck strain. I also like the fact they are foldable so I can just pop them in my bag. For the price, you can't really go wrong."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Tried this over a week now and I am amazed at the quality. This is different to other headphones, with option of actually using it for DJ it’s clear sound makes it easy. Cable quality is good and fits well. While it’s bit huge for some but for me it was perfect. Padding is good. Use this to play my guitar and with high cable quality it works very well."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"They're really cool overall!\nThese headphones look good, and sound quality is great. The battery lasts for (est.) 4+ hours of continual usage before needing recharging. The noise cancellation works fine but still get a bit of quiet noise pollution coming through, however that's on a noisy urban train so, no complaints."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I came from a Logitech G430 headset. Oh, how I have been missing out on so much bass. It completely changes my listening experience. These headphones are slightly bulky, however, but I like it. The pads are soft and I hardly feel the headband. Also, if you were wondering, like myself, what those squiggles are inside the earpiece, I attached a photo to show that they resemble a 'L' for the left side and an 'R' for the right side.
