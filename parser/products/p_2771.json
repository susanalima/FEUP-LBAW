{"release_date":"20 Dec. 2001","media_type":"cd","disc_number":"2","label":"Import","price":"Â£12.49","name":"Love Yourself Answer","stock":90,"brand":"Bts","q_a":[],"reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","content":"It came in perfect condition and I got the S version which is the one I really wanted! And a King Namjoon photocard, which I was very pleased with.\nThe album itself is beautiful and everything included within (notes, lyrics, photos) is perfect too. BTS have managed to outdo themselves again with such a wide range of genres on one album and every song conveys a different feeling for me.\nI'm so so proud of everything they've achieved and look forward to seeing what they do in the future."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Everything about this album is beautiful from the album itself, to the songs, to the message of the whole album. The message of Love Yourself: Answer & the Love Yourself series as a whole is what I love most. You can really just feel their sincerity throughout the album. I love how each member got a solo song and I absolutely ADORE the vocal line songs. You can just feel how far they've come through their songs and it's wonderful.\nEach song is so different from the other. Each solo song shows the power of each member and each song holds such a special message. This album makes you feel warm and it makes you feel comfort.\nLove Yourself: Answer is probably one of the best repackage albums out there. I got version F which is one of the most softest albums I've ever seen and it's just so beautiful."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I love this album! It came perfectly and I'm very impressed by it! I love how it is a random version because it's a nice surprise, I received my album today and it was meant to come tomorrow so I am super happy. I kind of wish there was a poster included but you know. There's only one problem i have is that the package got delayed and I had to wait even longer. It's not a massive problem but I was a bit annoyed when it happened. But overall i love the album. Thank you!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is a wonderful album. Totally genius. This album has everything! There isn't anything this album doesn't have. I'm now on a mission to own the other 3 versions to complete my set."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought this as a gift for a friend and it arrived very quickly. It was very safely packaged and sent off and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the product as well. I haven't opened it or tried the CD's as it IS a gift after all, but as of right now it looks alright to me. :)"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Iâ€™m giving this a 4 just because you usually get a poster in the album but I didnâ€™t receive one with this, so Iâ€™m disappointed in a way. The album itself is great and arrived in great condition."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I loved the album. It is a journey through the Love Yourself series. As always BTS push the boundaries and try new things out. IDOL is the perfect case in point. It is a must for the fan but also for those new to BTSâ€™s work."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"The most amazing album ever, I got a JHope photo card too, the album came wrapped in its plastic showing it was brand new, it also came with stickers and servey cards for BigHit.com. The music on the album is even better, they have a few remixes on the second disc which I love too! Amazing ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ also love the holo!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"The condition was super great but I didnâ€™t received the poster. Thatâ€™s was quite upsetting but overall everything is great."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"My album came in terrible condition. It was double printed on the album and there were marks on it and when I wanted to return there was no return label"}],"pictures":"\ndata:image/jpeg;base64,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\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"2771","specs":[],"cat":"music","available":true,"weight":"300g","media":"cd"}
