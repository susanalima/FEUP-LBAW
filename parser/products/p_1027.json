This thing feels absolutely sturdy and 'expensive' from the get-go. It looks really sleek and I love the 'bare metal' feel of not having a top cover over the keys. The feel of the keys is also excellent (and very much a personal preference thing). I went for the Brown keys that give you the fast switching but also some small amount of tactile feedback unlike the Cherry Reds.\nI expected the keys to be louder than they actually are as I'm a heavy typer, but I was pleasantly surprised that they weren't much louder than my previous keyboard with cheap non-Cherry keys.\nOne thing that will take a while to get used to however (why did they do this?) is that the keys with multiple symbols on have the 'shift' symbol *below* the non-shifted symbol. For example, the '5' key has the '%' below the '5' making it look as if you need to press 'shift' to get a '5'. All other keyboards I have every owned and used are the other way around. There might be a really good reason for this, but it makes you have to really think about some symbols. The worst for me are the '[' and ']' keys. These keys are used with 'shift' to produce '{' and '}' respectively. I used square and curly brackets a lot in programming, but these keys just look 'wrong' with the square brackets above the curly variants. I suppose this is something I'll get used to, but why do this in the first place?\nOne other small downside is that the USB passthrough requires a second USB port on your PC (the keyboard cable has two USB connectors on the end of it). I don't know why the passthrough couldn't have been achieved with a single connector as other keyboards manage. But this is a minor point as I say. It could be a major issue if you are low on spare USB ports however and want to use this feature.\nOnce I've used the keyboard and accompanying software more, I'll update this review. But for now, I'm loving it except for the upside down keys! :)"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought this to use with my ASUS Rog laptop when I'm actually at home (I travel a lot, hence no desktop for the time being).\nI've got to say the responsiveness of the Cherry Speed MX switches has actually improved my gameplay in Rainbow Six Siege and Battlefield 1.\nI swapped out the WASD keys for the textured keys that come as extras with the keyboard (key replacement tool is included) and I can still type emails etc as normal on the keyboard with them fitted. The textured keys are also slightly sloped for ease of finger placement.  There are also additional textured Q E F R textured keys, of these I only installed the R for those essential speedy reloads.\nThe RGB lighting of the laptop is controlled by Corsairs CUE software. It's a little clunky to use at first but after watching a few videos on YouTube I got to grips with it.  If you want to get the whole system up running fast, I recommend only watching how to import profiles from the Corsair website. There you can download profiles that will get some funky lighting effects running on your system ASAP so you can get back to gaming.  Once imported swapping between profiles in CUE is simply a matter of clicking on them.  The profiles are all encompassing, I also have Corsair Void Wireless headphones and an M65 mouse.  Some of the profiles also affect these."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is by far one of the best keyboards I have used. The keyboard that I am using comes with the cherry mx blue switches and in my opinion these are the best by far. It offers a satisfying click with a loud sound.\nThe back-light has some adjust-ability which allows you to customise the keyboards brightness and what keys light up. There is also a windows lock button that I absolutely love because it allows the user to not  be afraid of pressing the windows button when in use.\nI love the accessories that the keyboard comes with the keyboard comes with some textured key caps that are meant for gaming. There is also an included palm rest that is made with a nice soft touch plastic and is definitely not a gimmick unlike most keyboards corsair actually made the arm rest for ergonomic reasons whilst other companies put the rest there for the fun of it.\nOverall my experience with the corsair k70  has been really good  there is everything that you need for example there is a USB pass through that is amazing for daily use. Please if you are wanting to buy a keyboard that offers it all please turn to corsair I promise they will not let you down"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"This is an awesome keyboard and really makes typing a joy. I write for a side gig and play games as a hobby and never found this keyboard anything other than great to use. Customising the colours is really easy and changing between the three levels of brightness with a little button is a nice bonus. All the media keys worked out the box for me on windows 10. My only issue is that the LEDs are prone to fault and returning through Corsair is a real pain in the butt. That aside though, it's a fantastic piece of hardware, heavy and the brushed aluminium makes it feel quality and gives it a bit more of a classy vibe, rather than some of the tacky \"gamer\" branded peripherals.\nThe Corsair CUE software is really easy to use and customising lights is really just as simple as selecting which keys you want and picking a colour. The lights actually change in real time too, so you can see your changes as you make them.\nAll the keycaps are removable which makes it easy to clean or customise. I would highly recommend not cleaning with your regular household cleaners though, I did that and my buttons basically turned brittle and disintegrated. Stick to either soap and water or compressed air."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"\"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness\" O. Wilde\nIf you look at the HyperX Alloy Elite keyboard, you'll notice how similar it is to this Corsair. And that's just a single example, there are many more to choose this look and features. No wonder, it's just that good.\nMaterials and build are the best that's out there: sturdy aluminium case with nice brushed finish, wrist rest (67mm) with soft touch, dedicated potentiometer for convenient sound level control and media buttons to operate music player without leaving current game or app. All of those placed conveniently and without any risk of misclick. Also on front there is separate Windows lock and lighting buttons, while on the back USB 2.0 socket (my new favourite spot for flash drives) and lighting profiles switch. Do we even need any more buttons and switches than that? Of course not - it's all already there!\nInside the keyboard we have top quality Cherry MX Switches, famous for their reliability and lifespan. They operate perfectly, despite what's written throughout the web (Jitter? Where?!) The responsiveness is brilliant: you'll never need to hit a button twice and you'll never receive a doubled reaction after a single press.\nEach-button-individual backlight instantly reminds that imagination is the only limit: while more complicated ideas can take while to configure, the results are breathtaking: 3 levels of brightness, 16,8 colors and set of predefined settings will switch your desk into a rave party ;) The software is intuitive and doesn't put much strain on the OS.\nDisadvantages? Only one and not really a big one - the connection cord is quite thick (7,2mm) and ends with two USB 2.0 plugs. So if you plan to move the keyboard a lot, this is something you won't like at all. Otherwise, you won't even notice this as a problem.\nSummary: near perfect (why no leather on the wrist rest?) RGB keyobard with best switches on the market. The design, materials and performance impress and give you all you need to master your favourite games. Absolutely recommended."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I was given a Corsair K40 RGB keyboard for my birthday a year or so ago & my friend bought this keyboard saying, \"It's the best keyboard you'll ever have.\" So with his support I decided to purchase a K70 for myself, a big investment for me. I'm not old enough to buy, & don't have the money for Prime & yet it arrived long before the expected date which was amazing! Setting up the keyboard & its software took little to no effort. It's easy enough to clean & replace the individual key caps, some more gamer like keys are included, WASD went on straight away! The back light is very bright & everything is housed in a metal body which is very durable. The optional wrist rest included is held in well & makes the keyboard feel very good to type on, considering this is all written with it! The USB pass through has proved very useful & the media controls are fantastic, my only tip is to not spin the volume slider quickly as it's super sensitive in Windows 10. This keyboard is 100% better than the K40 I had before, using it on my dads PC (I gifted it to him), makes me not want to type, the keys are so sticky. If you're a gamer who loves a good keyboard or somebody in need of a new one then this is definitely worth a look. Worth the £125 I spent."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great keyboard the light system is brilliant and the iCue software works perfectly fine.  I didn't find it complicated, there is tons you can do with the software fully customising keys for your requirements or just leave it on the default lighting settings, you can create multiple profiles that all work with each other or specific games and software you choose.  If you don't have the software installed it defaults to red keys with WSAD white and arrow keys white.\nThe one thing I will say is I went for this keyboard expecting the keys to be silent or quieter then the norm... they are not... at all!  I've purchased some dampener rings which helps, but the loudness is just duller. I went for the corsair based on something I read about the keys being quiet, I quite clearly must have picked the wrong keyboard for silence, so that's on me.  The keys are very responsive and don't require to be pushed to the bottom as it says in the description... which may be one of the reasons it's regarded as quiet, but you'd have to press all the keys very slowly in order to achieve that.\nOverall very happy with what the keyboard does.  The shortcut features for media are good and having the roller for the volume is useful.  There is a button to switch the brightness of the lights, there are 3 light settings in total ranging from low, medium and high. One more press turns them off.  I'm currently typing this in the dark, I can see all the keys perfectly without having to turn on any additional lighting.  Great for gaming and ordinary use.\nEdit: 01/04/2019\nBeen meaning to add this for a little while.  Unfortunately after two months the Keyboard stopped working.  The lights worked perfectly fine (to an extent), just key presses were undetectable.  I exhausted every angle I could to test the keyboard and found it was a failure of the keyboard.  Went through the returns process and got a refund after two months.  I can't really fault the seller on service with this.  I won't drop it in score either, it is what it is.  Some things fail and I was dealt with promptly and respectfully."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Just wow. This keyboard is absolutely beautiful.\nI previously owned a razer blackwidow 2012 with blue switches, which I thought was a prety good keyboard (got mine second hand for £45), but the K70 is in a completely different league!\nI won't go into how awesome this keyboard is as many of the other reviews already do this... (if you are concerned about the spacebar, I personally think it's fine, what I would expect to be honest). What I will discuss is the MX switches.\nOriginally I ordered the keyboard with MX Brown switches (not RBG version as couldn't justify the price for lights, which was the right choice for me), which were ok, but coming from Blue switches it just felt a bit flat. They kind of felt like driving an Audi (nothing against Audi), they are solid, reliable, smart and good all rounders (if you are one of those gaming vs typing). However, exchanging the keyboard for the blue switch version (which was a truly painless process, 1 day exchange!), is a bit like trading in an Audi A4 and exchanging it for a ferrari 448. This tingly feeling that I am getting whilst typing this review is just, INCREDIBLE!\nPersonally, I am absolutely delighted I switched the browns for the blues, and tbh, the noise is really not that differerent (it's actually quiter than my Blackwidow) but if you are unsure, I would suggest trying both out and decide yourself.\nP.S. Turns out the keyboard is also a great level. I thought the keyboard was wonky when setting it up on my desk but to my suprise it was my table suface!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought the Cherry MX Red RGB version of the K70 Mk.2, and it was money very well spent. The main purpose  was for gaming to compliment a new gaming rig, however I have also been using it for work successfully. Whilst there is no intentional \"click\" with the MX Reds, there is definitely a \"clack\" as the key hits the bottom of the travel. The ideal solution would be to train yourself to press the key only as far as the actuation point, but that will take some doing. In the mean time, I have added some key dampeners to the letter keys which do make typing a bit quieter.\nThe build quality is outstanding, as is usually the case with Corsair products, and the CUE software works well with this and my other Corsair RGB products (M65 mouse and H115i cooler). Highly recommended."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I don't like the space bar as it's textured and will catch on your nail. Becomes annoying also when you've been typing for long periods as it does become slightly abrasive. I don't know why Corsair has done this as it adds nothing. The wrist rest is small and doesn't offer any support. The software to control the lights is buggy and annoying. For me, after multiple installs, it still keeps crashing. Seems to be a common issue. The lights aren't actually that bright, which is very noticeable if you set the colour to one steady light.\nHowever, the keys are a pleasure to use. The volume control isn't as easy to use as the spin wheel on my last Corsair  keyboard before it got destroyed by a spilled cup of tea... which hopefully won't happen this one considering it's water resistant. I do recommend this keyboard"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Let me just start by saying WoW! Not the game... the expression! :P This keyboard is really the absolute DEFINITION OF PERFECTION!\nBut before you tell me \"you don't know what you are talking about, razer it's better, bla bla bla\", let me tell you all the keyboards that I have owned.\nFor starters, I own currently K70 LUX with MX Speeds and STRAFE RGB with MX Silents. In addition to that, I recently was in the look for other keyboards and purchased/tested the Razer Huntsman Elite and the Roccat Vulcan 120 AIMO, but unfortunately both of them didn't meet my expectation so I returned them. Furthermore, at one point I owned a STRAFE with MX Reds and a Razer Ornata Chroma \"Mecha-Membrane\" Keyboard.\nNow, don't get me wrong. All keyboards are nice and have their own good things. However, I will focus specifically on the \"bad\" things compared to this keyboard which make aaaaall the difference, and that is: rattling or wobbling of the keys, the height of keyboard in general and height of the key.\nThe huntsman elite is an absolute joke when it comes to rattling and key height. I also found it tremendously slow to spam for games fast paced games for example, perhaps because of that little tactile clicky bump (similar to blue switches) it has and this made me realize that I much prefer a linear performance on a switch indeed. It has nice colours and a very confortable wrist rest if you buy elite version but other than that, it was just a no go. The K70 MX Speed is just too sensitive in my opinion for some reason, possibly the fact that your hand must be really \"curved\" when typing on those super high keys. MX Reds and Silent are \"meh\" in my opinion. They just have nothing in special. The only possible keyboard I would say is a competitor of this one is the Roccat which also has a low profile. However, that keyboard is odd looking, it also has that little bump (in this case not clicky so similar to Cherry MX brown swithces) which again slows me down, and the wobbling of the keys is indeed much greater than the one I found in this one which is virtually ZERO.\nRegarding this keyboard, I think it has THE absolute best feeling to type or game (for me) when compared to all of the others. And it is true what some people say that original MX Speeds where quite \"sensitive\" and you were prawn to making mistakes quite easily, but this is not the case with the low profile MX Speeds. They are AN ABSOLUTE DELIGHT TO TYPE ON!!! Trust me...\nNow, that's not to say that in addition to that, they do have lower travel distances which mean they are even faster both to actuate (1mm), and to bottom out (3.2mm), in case you are the kind of person that usually bottoms out the key when gaming or typing. This immediately gives you faster typing/gaming, and at the same time, it also gives you a better feeling because of the low profile, which is almost like typing in a laptop, but with a very premium feel to it. Moreover, this keyboard produces a more pleasant and quieter sound to the touch which I also think is an improvement since I want to be able to use this keyboard in my office. Finally, I think that the RGBs on this keyboard stand out more beautifully than any of the other keyboards, particularly Razer ones which I think are quite weak, and the only possible competitor again being the Roccat Vulcan 120 because of its fully exposed keycap. The Corsair logo lighting is just perfect, media keys and other extra buttons are delicious, and although I haven't actually programmed any profile, I can imagine the 8M for onboard profile storage coming handy sometime soon.\nOverall this keyboard is a must try! You won't regret it. Even if this keyboard were to \"fail\" me somehow, I would return it and buy it again over and over until I get a good unit. And if for some reason it failed me and had to claim Warranty, I would still give it 4 stars at the very least. I understand that QC issues can happen, but when it comes to rating to overall product that Corsair development team envisioned, I give 10 out of 5 stars, really. Just perfect.\nI hope this is helpful for you and wish you luck with your decision."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I have been shopping around for a decent keyboard for a while and what made me pick this one was the spill proof feature. I have had so many so called \"spill proof\" keyboards and none of them have survived a drink spill, but after seeing some review videos online I went ahead and got purchased it.\nOut of the box, it had a good weight to it and the palm rest was easy to attach, the ICUE software was already on my pc due to my corsair mouse but it picked up the keyboard straight away and did a quick update, very easy to set up and set the key backlighting to just how you like it. Yes the only colour is red but I have never really been one for multiple flashing lights of different colours going off. I like a crisp clean look and this gives just that.\nMy only slight negative is that the led under the ENTER button is very, very dim and kind of stands out with it not being bright but that is honestly my only negative so far. Typing is a joy, yes you don't get the click of a mx blue switch but these mx reds feel great and as for gaming, I think these are possibly the best on the market.

Also software is very flash in its user interface but its complicated, full of bugs and some basic things (such as stop it dimming ASDW) don't work or are not retained for next power on, you have to create a keyboard profile, save it as a user, load the profile on power on, go through a user interface... really... its a professional keyboard not a home build!

Ive bought the original k70 three times all with strange and odd scratches, k95 with even worse scratches and now the k70 mk2 expecting them to possibly fixed the quality issues however that was extremely not the case. The keyboard came with a few tiny pin sizes holes or dents. Its hard to describe it was dotted over the keyboard and small tiny dents on the top of the keyboard which are very hard to pick up on a camera. But what annoyed me the most was how the double shot keys were suddenly peeling. At least my “A” key was.

I sometimes think that this keyboard is actually too fast and it registers double the taps when I am typing, but that just might be me.\nThe brushed aluminum definitely gives it a premium look and feel, compared to other keyboard out there on the market.\nThe fact that they include another set of keycaps is also a bonus as the rubber finish on them definitely helps when gaming and typing.\n If I could give it only 1 negative, that would be that the left SHIFT key is a bit smaller than my liking, but hey, some people might now even care about that aspect as it doesn't make this a bad keyboard at all.\nI have moved from a Razer Blackwidow 2013 edition and I have to say that it was well worth the upgrade. These Cherry MX Speed switches definitely feel well built and long-lasting.\nThe packaging was a bit beaten up, but hey, that isn't Corsair's fault. I definitely recommend this keyboard, 5/5 stars easily.\nI will come back with more updates down the road."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great keyboard. Keep in mind if ur keyboard lights up when u power off ur pc and only way to fix it is unplugging the keyboard well there is another way going in the BIOS and enable ERP. That is the thing that allow u to charge device through usb when pc is off. And that thing causes ur keyboard to light up. And corsair don't care this issue been around for years -5 stars for them..."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I have been using this keyboard in a few different styles the past year. From the \"Blue\" to \"Red\" switches. This was an upgrade from a very decrepid and almost broken Razer Black widow Stealth 2013.\nThe overall build quality is much better than most mechanical keyboards on the market due to its very resilient back plate and frame less design. Which also makes it much easier to clean than your typical enclosed chassis keyboards. If you have compressed air at hand this process is made ever easier, but if you do not simply remove the key caps and take a vacuum to the surface to remove any crumbs/debris that have been caught while gaming.\nSince i have two different types of switches my recommendations are as following:\nCherry MX Red for long use in gaming due to the slightly lighter required force to register the key press, this will ultimately reduce figure fatigue in those crucial moments as well as quicker key presses to ensure you're playing as fast as you think you are.\nCherry MX Blues however i would suggest for anyone who personally enjoys the clicky sound  they give off when pressed. My other suggestion for the use of this keyboard would be people who do game but also spend large periods of time typing essays or reports on the same machine. The blue switches do give a much better typing experience overall.\nI would however like to see an RGB version of this keyboard WITH Cherry MX Blue switches as i am yet to find one, but i wont deduct marks for this."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Firstly, I must say, the quality of the keyboard is excellent. I am a touch-typist, and have always had what I believe to be a relatively quick typing speed. Well, all other keyboards seem sludgy in my hands compared with this one. Key response is lightning fast, and I didn't realise how much I've missed a mechanical keyboard!!\nBack in days-gone-by, all keyboards were made in a similar way... to eventually be replaced by their \"touch pad\" equivalents of today. This keyboard is positively responsive and an absolute joy to type with.\nEverything about this keyboard screams quality, I have the keys set to light up only when I type. This lights up for a brief amount of time and then fades slowly afterwards. Maybe not the best setting if you are in a public office and you're constantly typing in passwords, but that doesn't affect me. Another point to consider if you are in a public office is the noise the keyboard makes if you are typing constantly. The mechanical switches make the keyboard sound very 'clacky'. Again, not a problem in my home office, but something to consider if you do.\nI'm not a massive gamer, although I still like to play Command & Conquer now and then. The keyboard offers me everything I need in order to play the game successfully, key action is so definite with it.\nThe only negative point I have is that the wrist rest a little inadequate. A rest is designed to support the wrists at a height so that your hands don't bend upwards in order to strike the keys. This one really doesn't support your wrists at all, so I have re-enlisted the help of a cheap gel-filled rest I purchased years ago. This isn't enough to dock the keyboard itself a star, and the whole setup works fine for me.\nI can't imagine using another keyboard now, the rest seem so inadequate after this one. If you take the plunge with the money, you won't be disappointed, trust me!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This review is for the Corsair K70 LUX Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, now i don't usually write reviews but after using this beast of a keyboard for a while I thought I had two tell someone about it. First of all the build quality is absolutely stunning even the keys feel very comfortable when gaming\nand that fact you can change the w,a,s,d,e,r keys to grey to allow extra grip on the keys is tremendous in my opinion, second the keyboard is a good weight not heavy or too light but just right. The lighting is fantastic even though i purchased the none rgb version but because red is my favourite colour it was perfect for me as i don't need any more colours. So to summarise, the keyboard is excellent and corsair have done it again so if you are thinking about purchasing this keyboard I would highly recommend it especially if your a corsair fan like i am, So if you have taken the time to read this review I highly appreciate and happy gaming"},{"rating":"2.0","content":"The keyboard is really really solid, responsive and easy on the fingers. The key presses arent to loud compared to other mechanical keyboards ive had and has a VERY good finish.\nAlso this keyboard is extremely easy to clean with its large gaps.\nHowever... i don’t know if this applies to others but ive ordered this keyboard twice as a replacement for damage on it when it arrived. Apart from the box being dusty i didnt see any problems even whilst wrapped in plastic. After i took that all of that off i noticed a weird sharp bump on the hand rest on the rubber. That was also present on the space bar and weird scratches and paint kind of peeled off on the logo. For a premium product i expect at least a premium finish. The damage seems to be a common issue on older versions of this keyboard but seeing it in a new version was surprising indeed. Most of the damage was surface level however and didnt hurt its ability to function correctly. Mostly visual damage.\nAmazon support really helped me out with a ton of options of what i can do but liking the keyboard mechanicallly so much instead of taking a refund or a partial refund i opted to just get a replacement. Just be aware that your k70 may have some visual damage for unknown reasons.\nOkay just editing my review since this is the third time i got this keyboard and it has surface damage to keyboards metal plate as well as on the wrist pad but ive come to ignore that. This time the reason i returned it was because of damage to the keys or just their HORRIBLE finish. The keys from the arrow keys and the f1 to f12 keys have this awfully rough side to their faces. This also extends to the keys near print screen. I expected more corsair... i expected more"},{"rating":"2.0","content":"A mistake of mine not to return this and select a different keyboard from the beginning. I was impressed with the build quality at first until I noticed that is was wonky, and I had to add extra padding to one of the feet to stop it rocking slightly back and forth.\nAlso despite what other users say this keyboard is not especially easy to keep clean, though i can see the intent of the design, in reality, all it achieves is making the dirt that much more visible.\nAnd of course what I'm about to say is true with any keyboard, but especially with this one: do not get any significant amount of water, not even a too-damp cloth anywhere near it, it seems to take water inside like a sponge. and once it's there its pretty much game over. Unlike other keyboards I've owned this is all but impossible to take apart, countless screws all hidden under the keys and even after taking off all the keys and screws I could not get it open to dry it out.\nA frustrating experience. all in all."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Gen 3 CH-900018-UK Keyboard with updated and far more classy Corsair 'sails' logo not the unloved crossed swords.\nMX Cherry red's are a delight to use from both gaming and typing, lighting is generally good but better light dispersal in some of the key caps would be nice (this maybe achievable with custom key caps).\nThe software is convoluted and bulky to navigate through, but custom lighting options are easily downloaded from the community and installed.\nOnce you play around with the software it's easy and reasonably quick to set customs keystrokes, macros, folder shortcuts and lighting options.\nBeing able to macro custom all the keys is a big plus and provides good modulation within games.\nOverall a great quality product which ultimately you pay for in the price, however I can see this lasting a considerable amount of time, with a 2 year warranty it's a no  brainer!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"So far, I am happy. The build quality is good and the switches (MX Brown in my case) are exactly what I was expecting: responsive and not too clacky.\nThe lighting is decent (I have the plain red version) and the various modes available might be entertaining for some people. Palmrest is good size and you can change the angle of both the front and back of the keyboard, which is neat.\nNo setup issues, works fine through a USB3 dock, including the passthrough. The USB cables themselves are wrapped in a very heavy duty (but flexible) covering which I like.\nPerhaps the only design decisions that I don't like is the font on the keys, the fact that secondary characters (e.g. $) are not as bigthtly backlit (most likely due to a physical difference in the plastic on that part of the key).\nYou can set macros to any soft key, so even though my model did not come with the dedicated macro keys you can still get some use out of the software.\nI also received some replacement keys (with a different surface) and a key puller for gaming, which I did not expect."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"this is by far the best keyboard i have ever owned, it didn't come with rubber keycaps like it was supposed to, but that's okay.\nI really like the cherry MX red switches that it comes with, but i still have to install and try out the RGB programming settings. I am\nmost likely going to purchase some new keycaps. I still need to get used to the red switches, and the slightly smaller size compared to my\nlast keyboard, the Corsair K50 Raptor, which had 18 macro keys. This keyboard has none, but the numpad is easily modified for macros.\nthe wristrest is slightly too steep for me, much more comfortable than the last one however. If move the keyboard away from the table, it's much mor comfortable to type. Moving it\ncloser to me reduces errors, however. This review was entierly typed on the keyboard, with the wristrest on and the feet extended. My last corsair keyboard lasted me at least 3 years,\nafter purchasing it second hand. I expect this one to last me even longer! The after using the keyboard for about 10 mins, i feel i've really picked up typing on it, and i am finding it very comfortable and enjoyable.  After installing the iCUE software (which is very powerful, it has many modes and features) i've made my own presets.\nOverall this keyboard is defintely worth it's price, (i payed £90)"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"As a big MOBA/MMORPG gamer, I've always liked Cherry Red/Speed keyswitches for their low travel/actuation time of the keypresses to achieve rapid response times with minimal force. Some users claim it might be too soft, as Cherry speeds produce very low noise and don't have a clicky feel to it which means it will all come down to personal preference and what you're comfortable with.\nThe K70 rapidfire I bought is backed up with Corsair's renowned build quality, warranty and customer service. For me, I was after a mechanical keyboard which would last and this model was the perfect choice for me that strikes a good balance between value and other additional features such as onboard lighting and a disable Windows key to prevent accidental misclicks of tabbing out of my game.
