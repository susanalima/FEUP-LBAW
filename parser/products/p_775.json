I bought a Win 10 laptop locally and was so disgusted with how slowed down this laptop with 8RAM and a great processor was. Navigating Win 10 I hated from the first minute. When your doing something important the update kicks in keeping you from finishing your task. So I decided to return that laptop and order the Asus Chromebook.\nIt is beautifully designed, nice to look at and feel. It is light, very fast and handles at least 18 different websites opened without lagging. Display is crisp, colours not overwhelmingly candylike;) The lit keyboard is perfect and so are the keys in general.  I have switched to Beta version (beta chanel) and can use Google Playstore and all the  apps. It was so easy to switch: just google: how to switch chromebook from stable chanel to beta. Voila, a few clicks and you re done. From A to Z , from design to performance and all that comes with them: highly recommended. It is so worth the price. No regrets, I just love love love it. However, if you want to purchase a Chromebook please check beforehand if your printer is  eprint or cloud print ready. Mine is and it was easy to connect both via same Wifi . Also: if you think you cannot live without Microsoft Office, you might want to watch a few videos on Youtube first. I don t miss Office at all. There is an online office version and google docs on a chromebook. Easy to use, all good .\nUpdate: I m still happy after intensive use. The only tiny  con is: the outside looks so gorgeous in brushed silver but shows many fingerprints in no time"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is my 5th Chromebook (plus a chrome stick) and I had my eye on this after living with it's smaller brother the 10\" Asus flip which I loved also. The C302CA with the Android play store on the beta channel is on another level. The build quality is astonishing, the screen amazing. I didn't think I'd miss the USB until I needed something off my external drive, but all that was fixed with the excellent  dodocool USB-C Hub.\nGreat keyboard, much improved track-pad over the smaller flip and much easier to work on my work virtual desktop for all my Windows 7 needs (yes I know, dark ages!). This thing is excellent and exceeds my expectations in all areas. Highly recommended. I use this as a business tool, and so far, I haven't thought to reach for my Windows 10.1 device  (Asus UX305F). This is better the Ipad 12 pro in my view. I got mine for £435 on Prime day. What a bargain!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Love this so much.  Bought for client presentations, but now using it for nearly everything when casually sitting in living room, eg like this review ;)\nIs fast and slick and can download most apps, really powerful machine.  Use it for business, blogging, email, facebook, research, reading e-books, etc.\nGreat to have touch screen and to be able to fold it over and have on screen keyboard.\nOnly thing I think it is missing to an ipad is ability to take outward pics eg for taking copies of client papers etc...\nThis is my babe, it is one cool machine and well worth waiting those few months to black friday when it dropped to £420 ;)"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Works wonders so far. At first I was apprehensive about getting a laptop at the price it was at, especially when I found it on sale a couple of days later I had bought it, my attitude was not positive. Yet, after contemplating whether this laptop or apple is better for my school work, it seems that the 360 feature comes in handy whenever I'm reading articles or looking at power point presentations. It was a little daunting at first but as soon as you get used to its quirks and slight differences, the laptop is quick, efficient and mobile. Appearance wise - its silver and black finish is aesthetically pleasing, so that's definitely a positive."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Its a beautifully made thing for sure, light, it looks nice, its quite light, has a nice touch screen, good battery life and runs quite fast, but I couldn't get on with the trackpad or the Web /  Android versions of my daily programs.\nThe trackpad is the main way you interact with a laptop but this one has limited gestures and mine seemed to be off calibration so I was always readjusting the cursor position to select, especially text.\nI use Evernote on a daily basis but compared to the full program the Android App is very limited, while the web version, though better is still frustrating.\nSimilarly with email - I've never liked the web version of Gmail (has it changed in 10 years?) and I couldn't find anything I liked much better.\nSo, all in all, for the price saving over my regular laptop I wasn't willing to put up with the limitations of this one."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Bought over a year ago on Black Friday for around £430.\nGreat machine, really nice design (metal construction, backlit keyboard etc). Now that you can use Android apps it may well be all you need - can now use Microsoft Office if needed, download videos from iPlayer/Netflix etc, play games. It also finally gives some purpose to having a touchscreen.\nThe 360 hinge is also really useful, can use it as a stand to watch something on the train/in bed. To me it's essentially a laptop that you can use as a tablet (rather than the other way round as you might say an iPad pro or something is).\nBattery life is good, I've generally got 8-10 hours per charge.\nPersonally, I really like Chrome operating system as everything backs up automatically, you don't need software or anti virus and it doesn't slow down in the way I've found Windows machines have in the past (my old Chromebook is 6 years old (has been commandeered by my girlfriend), is still going strong and initially cost £200).\nAs long as you know the limitations of Chrome then it's a bargain, especially on sale but even at full price in my opinion."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"An everyday user, this one. Rather than going through the pain of turning on the Windows 10 PC, which is a constant annoyance to use, I just lift the lid on my Chromebook and have instant access to everything. Wonderful product. The keyboard is responsive, the screen is bright, and with a wireless mouse and bluetooth connection to my speakers and subwoofer, the ASUS is an ideal replacement."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"An amazing little piece of technology. It is fast and versatile with a lot of useful features. The fully-rotatable screen is even handier than I could have ever imagined. It is extremely lightweight and portable and the touch screen is very nice. It has a nice, small light-up keyboard that can be dimmed or brightened instantly using keyboard commands. The mousepad is fine with different finger gestures achieving various things. It has a good battery life and charges very quickly.\nObviously, there is no disk drive and the physical memory of the device is limited. This is completely redeemed by the 100gb of free google drive space; allowing all of your files to be saved in the cloud instantaneously. Google Docs is a perfect alternative to Microsoft Office, with a clear user interface and the added bonus of being able to share files with others instantly. You have to use a USB adapter because the USB 3.1 Type-C ports are a different shape and size than the usual USB ports that most people are familiar with. You need a Google account for this device but this can be set up when you first turn it on. Chrome OS is easy to use and seemingly well-designed. One or two apps didn't seem to work that well (Spotify) so I used the website version instead. The apps make it seem more like a tablet than a PC at times but that's not always a bad thing: some apps integrate the touchscreen very nicely.\nThis Chromebook is well worth the price for what it gives you and I very much recommend it. I've been using it for about a month now and there have been no issues that couldn't be solved with a bit of computer know-how. This was my first experience with a Chromebook but I found the conversion from Windows to Chrome almost completely hassle-free. Plus, they give you an excellent free screen wipe to clean your fingerprints from the touchscreen."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Shortly after arrival of my ASUS C302CA-GU011  (Intel m7-6Y75)  I identified a quality control issue with the trackpad which I am most unhappy with. It appears loose on the left side so that when you click towards its left corner there  is a double movement of the trackpad accompanied by an unpleasant mechanical clunking sound as if it is catching against something internally. The trackpad also seems to have greater travel at its left corner relative to its right. This issue affects the ergonomics of the device making it extremely unpleasant to use and detracting from what would otherwise be a very enjoyable user experience. I have notified Amazon and am returning the device for a full refund in the hope that the next one I purchase will be free from this issue."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"The first thing you notice is how superb the build quality of this Chromebook is. Its premium aluminium casing, backlit keyboard that's a joy to type on and its crisp bright full HD screen. The hinges are sturdy but there's no issue folding it back to use as a tablet. Speakers could be a little louder but they sound very good considering how small they are.\nIt has a decent battery life of 7 to 9 hours and it charges incredibly quickly with the included charger.\nI see no lag or performance issues even when having multiple browser tabs and Android apps open, it all works seamlessly. I love the way Chromebooks just pick up where you left off the instant you open the lid!\nNegative points would be the trackpad and Bluetooth.  The pad could be more sensitive as it occasionally fails to properly recognise an input. But it's certainly not a deal breaker. Bluetooth is fussy, I was able to connect one of my speakers perfectly but another one wouldn't keep synced. My phone was fine but it won't play nicely with my headphones. This is the only disappointment I found.\nI would highly recommend this Chromebook, it's easily the best all rounder in design, build quality, performance and price."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I Switched from a Macbook and have not touched my Macbook since buying this Chromebook. Chrome OS in itself is very fast, has no lags anywhere. With full aluminium body and a fantastic keyboard, this machine is a great one. Price might feel a little high to someone with a very aligned mindset of Chromebooks being cheap, but you have to remember the specs and build quality. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is my first chromebook and I was a bit nervous about whether I would miss a windows laptop. However, after a lot of research I decided to take the plunge and go with this. It is the best decision I have made. The chromebook looks good, it runs smooth and fast, starts up in seconds and is fun to use. I do not miss windows one bit."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great piece of kit. Even better as got it in a lightening  deal. If you don't want all the hassle of a Windows pc with the bonus of being able to get android apps this is the chrome book for you. It has all the perks of a laptop with the ability to be used as a tablet when on the go."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Really like this Chromebook, there is a learning curve but took me a week. If you are not a designer or gamer then this will suit your needs. Get this or wait for a newer model because this did come out last year but still I consider the only competitor to the pixelbook. Battery is good, app support good except high power games because of graphics support but sound could be louder."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I have had a Chromebook that I purchased 5 years ago for travelling. It has been great but was getting a bit slow. I purchased the Asus expecting it to have better features but was surprised to see just how good it is. I am very impressed.\nI would definitely recommend this Chromebook."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"When it works this device allows you to use the touch screen and fold over so that it is a tablet.\nThe problem is that it frequently fails and you cannot reply on it\nI have lost count of the number of times it just stops working and reboots\nYou can save files e.g. word to its memory, but the default is online.\nThe app for word does not work well and frequently seems to end up with a corrupted file\nthe app for oneNote keeps on failing and turning itself off,\nafter logging on again and getting back to where you were, it logs itself off again.\nUnless you cannot manage without a touch screen buy a small laptop PC in stead."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"First step over to the Chromebook world and I'm really impressed for those who do casual computing. Really good-looking and capable device but do notice a small whirring sound during use, which can be annoying in quiet rooms. Is made worse when plugged in. Doesn't seem to affect performance, but upon Googling seems to be a common ASUS issue."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Fantastic product. High quality feel to everything, very fast and responsive and in tablet mode it's a revelation. Android apps work straight from turning the device on. Setting up with my Google account only took a few minutes. The touch screen is excellent and the hinge system looks very robust."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Put simply - best laptop ever! First time used Chrome o/s and could not be more pleased. This has replaced my old Windows laptop as was getting fed-up with slow response and boot-up times - yes, tried all the usual tricks to resolve this! - together with constant overheating and ever more complicated MS apps. I no longer need MS Office as found an app (check out ZOHO.com) - free! that does everything Office does and has compatibility with Word, Excel and PPT.  Android apps from the Playstore work perfectly and Chrome DOES  work offline as apps requiring text input synchronise as soon as a connection becomes available.  Connecting items such as e.g an optical drive is easy using a USB hub with a -C connector. This is a beautifully engineered piece of equipment with phenomenal battery life.  Highly recommended to anyone who is looking for a viable alternative to Windows."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I had the Acer Chromebook CBS 431 which I love. I had it for 2 years and am consistently telling people how it has improved and gotten faster over the years rather than the opposite (like any windows machine I ever owned). I didn't even feel the need to change, the Acer is so good. I saw this device - the ASUS Flip, on offer at Amazon over christmas and saw it had great reviews on Chromeunboxed.com and other places so I ordered. It's a fantastic device. Easily feels worth three times the cost. Great build quality, everything is faster than on the last device, battery time is a little less (but it is more powerful and has a touchscreen so it's understandable) but generally I can use it almost all day without charging."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"As a Chromebook, my third one so far, this is certainly the best I had. I found good reviews on this laptop particularly in favour of the keyboard, and I must say: they are all correct. It's quite pleasant and accurate to type on this laptop keyboard, and the key-travel reminds me a bit of those once used on MacBook computers. I think the laptop is fast enough for running Chrome OS, with a CPU that balances well enough energy consumptions with adequate performance."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Real quality build, backlit keys, fast and great for the standard uses of a chromebook  ie : email, youtube, news reading, document preparation, image reviewing and light photo editing."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"A bit biased here as I have Asus monitors GPU, motherboard wireless router. The screen is very clear and sharp, backlit keyboard, which turns off when folded back on its self. So, making it a tablet. Speakers are feeble, what do you expect with notebook this thin. Bought for the Wife who is trying to learn to use computers. I love it, it is so much better than my iPad, before I forget she loves it."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"The Chromebook without the over inflated price! Build quality is excellent and has the feel of a high end notebook. I can say this with the knowledge Ialso own two MacBook Pro’s including the latest one and Windows laptops. For the price and if Chrome OS works for you, highly recommend. Definitely worth the punt."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I love this chrome book glad i got one. will not go back to windows again.using every day as main work horse. very happy bunny."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I thought the product looked good, and was solidly built. Unfortunately, the battery life was variable between charges, and I was concerned for its long term prospects.\nIt was difficult to get used to the way that apps had to be 'launched' rather than sitting on the desktop, and some of them didn't look right to me.\nAs an object, it looked very good, but I decided to return mine, based mainly on the information above."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Had this for 4 months now and ver please with the performance, web browsing and android apps and games you can use.
