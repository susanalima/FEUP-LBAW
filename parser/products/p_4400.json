So far very happy with the move. A robust high spec laptop. Very happy with Windows 10 as well. Reason for moving was Apple's lack of development of MacAirs after so long and their breathtaking prices. Microsoft Surface is a dream to use and the touchscreen is great.  Two downsides - you cant migrate Outlook for Mac back to PC (!!).  The alcantara keyboard material feels nice. Not sure how durable this is or how hygienic - developers should have thought a bit more here.  But def gets 5*.\nUpdate - October - I've regrettably gone back to MacAir. Despite 4GM of RAM the laptop was painfully slow and tech support fairly basic."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Excellent product. Super smart looking. Nicer than my MacBook Air. Batter lasts around 6-8 hours max for me."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Iâ€™m very impressed with this. I bought what I think is the lowest-spec Surface and it is a real treat. I knew Iâ€™d have to supplement the 128gb ssd drive with my old separate drive. And I knew Iâ€™d need to buy a dock to run an extra monitor and other inputs. I got the Surface cheap, and the dock too, - otherwise Iâ€™m not sure I could have justified paying all that money. The only downside is that my extra monitor, which I thought was brilliant, now turns out to look very low res in comparison with the Surfaceâ€™s stunning display. The other slight downside is this is my first engagement with Windows 10 and Iâ€™m losing the battle. Inspite of my best efforts with Firefox and pdf readers and reading ebooks on Kobo, Win 10 seems magically to find ways to default back to Edge nearly every time. Thankfully FileMaker Pro has no Microsoft rival and works really nicely. But, - Well done Microsoft for this Surface laptop. I like it a lot."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"It doesn't say in the write up but this is an American laptop, it comes with both leads for UK and USA plugs but the keyboard is slightly different to the UK version, no Â£ sign on the keyboard unless you change the context to a UK keyboard, which then causes the problem that the @ isn't on the key that it is shown on and you lose # as that becomes the Â£ sign, my daughter originally wanted to return it but to buy it in UK version costs Â£400 more, she says she will live with it but it is not quite the bargain that it first appears to be from this seller."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I honestly bought this laptop with so many doubts on its credibility and durability. But it turned out to be a beautiful piece of technology, I've only had it for a day so I cannot speak about its long-term performance, but so far so good. I bought this as an emergency laptop because mine broke, so wanted a high-end, speedy laptop with a great keyboard and this laptop fits that description. So if you are thinking of buying this laptop it is soooo worth it."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Nice laptop to use.  Very poor connectivity, only one USB port.

I have to say this has to be one of the best laptops I have had the keyboard is beautiful designed along with the fabric around the mouse/keyboard area which feels fab- comfortable when typing- gives a more expensive feel. The fact that the laptop has a touch screen is amazing- makes multitasking seamless, couldn't imagine not having a touch screen now- I use this a lot now that I have one definitely well worth buying this model- not to most expensive but great value for the money and is great for multitasking and the screen resolution is amazing- clarity and colour ratio is fantastic. The power cord is amazing if you accidently pull the cord the magnetic connection to the laptop just disconnects so you won't pull the laptop off of a surface which helps to stop damage to the laptop- which I think is amazing- no more laptop drops. The battery life is amazing I've had this laptop 3 days so far and haven't had to charge yet- depending on use but overall would say the battery life is fantastic. Wish I had looked at the surface line sooner (I love my MacBook for certain things- integration with my other apple products) but the surface laptop is a great laptop without the price tag of higher end laptops- speed is fab definitely a great inexpensive laptop with amazing features that even more expensive laptops don't have. Well worth buying- no real bad points thus far."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Ours was was bought for my daughter from John Lewis for a lot more than this - although we did get a 3 year guarantee with them....\nThings I like:\n1) Screen ratio:\n  - it has a squarer profile than its rivals - designed for work, not watching movies  - please note!\n2) Physical Interface:\n  - keyboard has useful travel and feels good (note major rivals have awful keyboards - Dell XPS 13 is hideous)\n  - consistent, accurate, touch-pad - Windows laptops have better touch-pads nowadays and this is excellent\n  - touchscreen - superb and fairly fingerprint resistant - screen quality is phenomenal - absolutely beautiful\n  - webcam - this is in the right position - beware the Dell XPS 13 which points its camera up your nose\n  - speakers - surprisingly loud and surprisingly good - better than my Â£2k gaming laptop\n3) Weight:\n  - this thing weighs nothing\n4) Looks:\n  - Beautiful external finish\n  - soft 'fabric' interior - don't worry about this - just give it a wipe with a soapy cloth every now and then and it will be fine - my daughter's is spotless. It feels lovely\n5) Performance:\n  - this thing runs multiple windows and applications flawlessly - you don't need more power\n6) Battery Life:\n  - six months old and still giving 8-10+ hours a day depending on use - if you are working rather than playing games, you don't need the power block for a days work\nThings that could be better:\n1) If you are a power user, you might want to upgrade - you can't - like an Apple, everything is glued & soldered in\n2) Ports - yup it hasn't got many but has more than my wife's Â£2.5k Macbook Pro\n3) The completely unnecessary i7 version with 16GB is laughably expensive.\nConclusion:\nYou will read amazing reviews about rivals:  the Dell XPS - really expensive, feels cheap, has a non-touch, not great screen as as standard (you have to pay towards Â£2k to get a better screen with touch) and has a pretty nasty keyboard; HP Spectre - poor battery life and keyboard, Lenovo - feels like a toy and in my experience of this brand, will break.\nThis is like an Apple product to me, designed just to work without any possibility of home maintenance or upgrades and it does that without the excessive 'mac-tax' pricing of Apple products.\nI absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants a thin'n'light, all-rounder, 13\", Windows laptop.\nBought one for my daughter first and one for myself, too, because I like it so much."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Super quality, worth the money. It looks sleek and is easy to transport - hubby very pleased with it."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Excellent laptop. Actually bought it from eBay brand new for Â£750, so recommend checking eBay if you are on a budget. Absolutely amazing build quality, quick and free upgrade to windows 10 pro, stunning screen and really solid keyboard and glass track pad. Also super slim and light weight! I haven't had it long enough to fully try out the battery life but so far it looks very promising.\nI was initially worried about the alcantara keyboard finish, but if you have also had the same concern, do not worry; it is very durable feeling, it also has a finish that prevents it from getting wet, so any liquids on it just bead and fall off. If you look after your laptop and do not use it with grubby, greasy hands, I guarantee the keyboard will look just as good a year later as when you first bought it. Overall a super laptop, definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I've been using this laptop for more than a month. The price made me hesitant at first but after I completed the purchase, I regret nothing. The facial recognition technology is excellent. It takes less than 5 seconds to wake up from sleep mode. Every thing about this laptop is perfectly designed and it has gotten quite a few compliments from my friends."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"This laptop is almost perfect. Certainly for school, I have found the storage more than generous, and they keyboard functional and easy to type on. The laptop is light and portable, easily slips in my school bag. It is also great for watching and streaming (only in my free periods of course ;)). In spite of its lightness in terms of weight, the screen is very large and lovely to watch things on. There are only a couple of things I wasn't such a fan of:\n1) The screen is often far too bright. I have it turned to 0% brightness, and yet in a slightly darkened room, this thing still burns my eyes. There are no options to make it any dimmer.\n2) The battery life is somewhat poor. It lasts me through the day at school, but I am still charging it every night - my MacBook, on the other hand, can go days without being charged.\n3) Delivery was abhorrent. It arrived on time, but had clearly been mishandled by the postman, as one of the silica gel packets explored inside, and little plastic balls are still falling out of the vents, weeks after I've purchased the machine.\nOther than these small thing, however, I would highly recommend this laptop, especially for a sixth form or university student."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"The hardware is impressive. The screen is very thin (for a touch screen) and it is bright and crisp. The new material is nice to rest one's wrists on whilst typing. Battery life is adequate and speed is OK on the low-end machine I have. I imagine the bigger processors and memory will make it a pleasure to work on. All in all this is a good buy, but not absolutely excellent. Beware:\n1. The operating system is super fast but pointless. I really tried to stick with it, but there is NO software worth speaking of outside Microsoft's own and some unknown apps; basically you will have to upgrade to Windows10 pro - which thankfully and for now comes for free with the machine. But a bit of a bother.\n2. You will need some sort of a convertor dongle for there are only two ports on it - one of which is a USB. There is a second USB on the charger itself, but when you are on the move, that's not very useful.\n3. The actual keys on the keyboard are less than perfect. They feel plastic and too light. There is a wobble to them as well... The travel is not strictly vertical.\n4. The windows pro version is a tad heavy for the low end machine. Nothing worrying at current version, but as they update Windows I expect it will become sluggish fairly quickly.\nAs is,I have to give it five stars for both hardware and software. Windows is pretty impressive even compared to macs these days, and despite some minor bugs it is a pleasure to own and use."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"The newer model is faster and, most importantly, cheaper!!
