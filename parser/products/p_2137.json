I purchased their 2nd CD because of the reviews and was blown away by it and decided I'd give this debut a shot.  So glad I did.  This is one fantastic piece of work for a debut CD.  Brilliant songs on this one, especially Robbers.  This is a brilliant band with awesome songwriting skills and very talented musicians.  I don't normally get hooked on a band at first listen, but this is the 2nd band I got hooked on at the first listen of their 2nd CD and had to purchase this one.  Glad I did.  This is some brilliant music and a change from the garbage that's out there today.  Hopefully The 1975 will be around for a while.  Awesome band and I definitely highly recommend both of their CDs.  Guaranteed you won't be disappointed.  I'm not.  Finally, some awesome music!"},{"rating":"2.0","content":"The postage stickers were put directly onto the vinyl sleeve? This seems like an incredibly stupid thing to do, why not just wrap the vinyl and then stick things to the outer paper? The sleeve is now ruined, the stickers took off most of the vinyl art and otherwise left sticky residue on it. Very disappointing :("},{"rating":"5.0","content":"this is so edgy i've considered making a soft grunge page on tumblr"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Absolutely brilliant - love Chocolate which is why I bought the album.  Fantastic tracks on there The City, M.O.N.E.Y., Heart Out, Settle Down - Particularly Great.  Brilliant album, can't stop playing it!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I am a relative newcomer to The 1975 having discovered them recently after seeing their live performances (on TV) from Glastonbury and T-in the Park and am now a huge fan.  I have listened to this album non-stop.  Favourite tracks include The City and Robbers.  Good mix of some good atmospheric tracks. Have since purchased their second album and tickets to see them on tour in Newcastle in December."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is the best album I've bought in years I love the song \"chocolate\" so got the album and was soooo not disappointed. I love how its like rock/electric pop but they look like the black veiled brides!( my niece likes them me not so much I'm 37 for gods sake lol) feel I need to point out the band is called \" the 1975\" in name only don't expect 70s music think some reviewers have been confused lol BUY THIS NOW xx"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Love this album, loooove Matty's voice and hair. Robbers is my favourite track on the album. But it is really hard to pick a favourite because they are all really great."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This band is getting bigger now, after just releasing their second album but this first album is just as good! Lots of great songs, an alternative/indie band, so not everyone's taste but have had a fair few hit songs now. Glad I have this album in my collection now!!"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I am not reviewing the band or music.\nWe paid for the cd though amazon as we are fans of the autorip mp3 service which is great for our phones with the bonus of having a cd in the car when arriving in the post.  The 1 disc version was £5 but the 2 disc special edition £12.  Only dics one was available at an mp3.  I am sure there a reasonable explanation but this was not mentioned in the description so a little disappointing as we bought this edition specifically for the second disc-eps."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This album is amazing. The 1975 are destined for good things. Definently listen to this album throughly before listening to ILIWYS because this really shows you what they are about, and where they are coming from. Brilliant song writing and compositions."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"The singles hook you in and then the whole album builds into a catchy, enjoyable and excellent piece of work.\n80s all over this but also something new.\nWill be playing this for a few years. Top stuff.\nOh and Menswear is a genius track!!!\nWARNING: After a few listens it is addictive and you will be hooked!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Love it love it love it.\nIts modern pop meets the 80s.  As long as you aren't offended by references to drugs and sex, you like a catchy tune/melody and have a soft spot for tracks that sound like a modern rework of the three men and a little lady soundtrack, you'll love this!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Was looking for something new. I don't get to hear the radio, will only for maybe 20 min a day and that's an old persons show. Heard about them as it was on a show. Love it"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I've always had the 1975s music on my ipod but I recently rediscovered them and I fell back in love with their music. Love all the songs and there are SO many of them too. The vinyl itself could have been a lot clearer compared to my other vinyls so the quality is a little shoddy. P.s the vinyl is translucent :D"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Wow - this album is fabulous and on vinyl.... amazing. Love it!\nGreat price and fast delivery."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought this CD for my boyfriend for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. I (quite terribly!) had never heard of The 1975 before buying him the CD, at his request, but have definitely become a fan since!\nThe CD was received in good time and in good condition."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Pre-ordered this album due to the fact that I loved the song 'Chocolate' so naturally I was apprehensive that I might have jumped the gun. The 1975's debut, however, is a superb example of why customers used to get that buzz of a new album prior to a society of downloads. In a period of music where an album is largely accessible before release, this Manchester band have kept wraps on a finely crafted modern masterpiece."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Love, love, love The 1975. The 80's pop vibe is infectious and you cannot help but to sing along. From the opening bars of chocolate, I bounce along. With some censored words, by me, even my children song along. \"All we seem to do is talk about TREES, is the line they sing!\" Settle down is my fave track x"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Chocolate, Sex and Girls were all the hits i knew on this album as they've gotten loads of radio play. There's some other good songs here too though, incl. Menswear, City, Heart Out and Settle Down. Recommend for any fan of Feeder, the 1975 have a similar vibe"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Happy with purchase"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"A cd"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Love this album. Only started listening to the 1975 just before their second album release so was eager to listen to this when I could."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"The album is just brilliant. It is full of really good songs and they are for any audience as the music is mixed and full of joy. When getting The 1975 it came with 2 LPs which is great because there are more songs to listen to as well. the vinyl's come in a platinum colour and beats the classic colour black on this occasion.  The vinyl came well packaged and was in great quality. I would recommend this to others to buy this album."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Just amazing."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Bought this album not really knowing much of The 1975's music, only their hits. I have to admit, their singles are the more upbeat tracks, and quite a lot of the other songs on this album are slower, more.. atmospheric..?\nDefinitely not a bad thing that the rest of them are a bit slower; I think it is an absolutely amazing album.\nWould definitely recommend :)"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Good product. Swift delivery."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"One of my all time favourite albums. I can't name a song I dislike on here. Please give this a listen; you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great cd"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great music but not as good as 2nd album."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Cannot put into words how much I love this band. Send shivers down my spine. Just incredible. Best album in the last year in my opinion. Absolutely killed it by listening to it on repeat for months!
