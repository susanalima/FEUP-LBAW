{"name":"Logitech K780 Multi-Device Wireless USB, Bluetooth Keyboard, Wireless Keyboard for Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, iOS, Android, Switch Between Devices, Quiet Keyboard, QWERTY UK Layout, Dark Gray/White","brand":"Logitech","weight":"1 Kg","model":"920-008041","color":"Dark Grey/White","release_date":"29 Jun. 2016","price":"£50.00","stock":309,"q_a":[{"q":"what would be the most suitable mouse for this keyboard","a":"Any mouse will do."},{"q":"Will it connect to 3 different unifying receivers? 2 PCs and one Laptop","a":""},{"q":"Is the device stand detachable or fixed? This question has been answered, but I want to know whether it could be removed with a little effort","a":"The tablet / device stand is fixed to the keyboard with no angle adjustments. Despite this the viewing angles are good, although most tablets will need to be out of their case to fit int the keyboards stand."},{"q":"How easy it transport? Is it light to carry? Thanks","a":""},{"q":"Does it come with a unifying receiver or do I need to buy one separately?","a":"Yes, it does come with a unifying receiver."},{"q":"Is there any conceivable reason this wouldn't work with linux? do you have to run any supp;ied software?","a":"It should work fine. You might need a device driver installing but there are lots around. And there's Solaar you can check out if you want something a little more managed. There's no supplied software to run - other than the built in device driver n the dongle if you want to use it."},{"q":"Is there a caps lock indicator","a":"It shows on the screen but there's no indicator on the keyboard."},{"q":"Is this product available for purchase in the US?","a":"I believe so as it is an American brand"},{"q":"are the batteries replaceable? It says they have a two year life.","a":"Yes, absolutely."},{"q":"How big is the return key? Differs between images","a":"This is a standard non-US keyboard.  It takes up two rows of keys as in the image and almost as wide as the back button.  I've noted that US keyboards tend to take up one row of keys so the return key is quite large."},{"q":"Does it need a special mouse or will any wireless mouse do?","a":"It’s just the keyboard. Use whatever mouse you want with it. It has a usb dongle for laptops but can be connected via Bluetooth. I use a Logitech mouse with mine on its own dongle too."},{"q":"Is this compatible with Macbook pro","a":"It can be paired with the Logitech unifier or via Blu-tooth to either Mac or Windows OS. Should therefore be ok with the MacBook pro"},{"q":"Can you combine USB and bluetooth for switching? i.e. connect to iPad with bluetooth then switch to pc with USB receiver?","a":"Yes tthat's fine. I have an ipad connexted via Bluetooth and 2 PCs  connected  using the  receiver and it works a treat."},{"q":"can the K780 be used with two unifying wireless receivers i.e. one in each of two computers","a":"You don’t need 2 receivers as you can switch between different devices with the white buttons at the top with Bluetooth connections."},{"q":"Can it be placed on a table?","a":"That's an odd question! :  Yes, absolutely it can.  It has rubber pads so it shouldn't make any marks."},{"q":"How would I pair a mouse with this? And which one would work best? Thanks.","a":"The keyboard is not linked to the mouse. I am using logitech mouse anywhere 2. My mouse works over several devices, there is a button under the mouse where I swap to the next device. Works well. It could worked better if both the keyboard and mouse switched to next device using the same button on the keyboard."},{"q":"Can it be used to access the bios or boot loader using the usb receiver? it's normally a pain on bluetooth.","a":"USB works for boot loader and BitLocker password prompt on Windows. Note the BT does NOT work with unlocking FileVault on macOS which is a bug since macOS has it's BT initialised at that time and it works with Apple's keyboard and with Logitech's own K480"},{"q":"Is this too lightweight for iPad Pro 12.9...?","a":"I don't have a iPad Pro to test with, but it holds the normal iPad 2 fine and I have to apply quite a lot of force to make it fall over. The keyboard is quite heavy, so I think it will be able to hold your iPad Pro."},{"q":"Can this be used with the xbox 1","a":"don't have an xbox, but don't see why not - it has bluetooth - no trackpad on this though so you'd need a pointer as well, and its pretty heavy to use on a lap"},{"q":"Will this work with an apple mac using macos sierra?","a":"Yes brilliantly I use it myself and works with iPads as well!"},{"q":"Do you have to hold down fn key to get F keys to work?","a":"Well yes, but using the logiteck options software you can revert this. Thats is F1-12 will be main key and multimedia func will be activated by fn key."},{"q":"Which is the start and start buttons on the 780","a":"\"...the start and start buttons..\"??  The Start button is the 3rd key in on the bottom left of the keyboard."},{"q":"I have two pcs in the same room, one already has the k380 connected. can i add a k780 for use with the second pc simultaneously without interference?","a":"I believe you can, just choose the pc from your keyboard manually"},{"q":"Do special charecters like ù ò actually work? Bought a mk850 and half of them weren’t working or even matching the button they were shown on..","a":""},{"q":"Amazon shows there is a shipping delay of 1-2 months for the UK version. Why?","a":"With Prime mine arrived the following day."},{"q":"what is that marble-like part made of?","a":"it is made of hard rubber"},{"q":"If you use this with the M720 mouse, do you have to switch them between computers independently or can you switch both with a single button push?","a":"independently"},{"q":"How does this pair with my phone? Thanks.","a":"Yes. Sometimes I use the Bluetooth usb connector to connect the keyboard to my pc, while also Bluetooth pairing with my pad and my iPhone all at the same time, switching between the three with single presses of keys. Works really well. Would recommend."},{"q":"Can anyone please confirm if an ipad pro 12.9\" will fit in this? i'm worried the weight would pull it over. thanks in anticipation","a":"I use it for mine and it is fine"},{"q":"Is this more of a portable Keyboard - or is it suitable / comfortable enough as a main keyboard for iMac?","a":"only portable if you've got strong arms - its a pretty substantial piece of kit certainly usable as a main keyboard"}],"reviews":[{"rating":"3.0","content":"This is a lovely piece of kit and keys work really well for me (as a touch-typist). I've docked it a star due to the strange positioning of the HOME, END, and DEL keys (yes it's a UK QWERTY as I anticipated). Come on, Logitech, keyboards have been around plenty long enough to standardise the location of these keys. I now have them in different places at home and work. I was amazed at the relative ease of connectivity but please ignore what is on the inside of the box and look instead at the downloadable manual."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Been on a journey. Originally I was a mac user since the mid-00s, then 2016 arrived. Then, I decided to join the PCMR and get a keyboard with mechanical switches. Cue Cherry MX Blues, etc etc. I first had a Corsair K70, then a Razer BlackWidow Tournament Edition. But the thing was... ...wires. And I wanted to be able to switch between my Windows environment and my Raspberry Pi without a problem. And perhaps my Android phone too (yes, I really, really ditched Apple).\nNow that I've 'moderated' a little bit, I discovered the Logitech MX Anywhere 2S mouse. And then, days later, I was encouraged to buy this beauty. This is not a gaming keyboard by any stretch, but the keys are as good as the ones on my Lenovo ThinkPad T480S, and that's saying an awful lot. They make a lovely noise which is dampened slightly by the hard rubber. The alphanumeric keys are concave, whilst the fn keys and modifier keys are convex.\nThe pressure feels just right. There is no plastiky feel. As I said, this really feels every bit as good as a ThinkPad keyboard. The keys feel responsive, but not to the point they feel unstable. The key travel is about as long as you would get on an Apple Wireless keyboard, but when the keys hit the end of their travel it just feels... ...nice. You want to keep typing. That's why this review has gone on for so long.\nNow to the rubber stand bit. I like it, it doesn't get used much, but it sure is a nice visual feature. The rubber gives the keyboard a whacky weight to it. You could hit someone and jolly well hurt them with this thing. It's rubber, but it's not tacky. It feels incredibly good quality. This is like a ThinkPad keyboard mixed with a little modernity. Perfection.\nedit: and the BlueTooth switching is sublime. Happens within seconds."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"The K780 has become my top keyboard, I use it on my desktop even when on my laptop. It has circular keys so you can't easliy mis-type.. by having a gap between the keys, if you press the wrong one, you're pressing nothing. There is a slight learning curve for those who touch-type; but it's a very small one.\nIt has a little holder for portable devices such as iPads and Phones, and has 3 Bluetooth options.... you hold down on the 1/2/3 white keys and it enters pairing mode. Then accept them on your device you're using - and Tudah' 1 You''re done, when you want to jump from one to the other, simply press the button and the keyboard will siwtch.\nMy only slight wish was that the battery was a USB-C or even any USB. It uses standard AA batteries, which should last you a good 9-12 months depending on what you're typing.\nBeing a laptop user, it's also the first time in a long time where i've had a keyboard that has a Number Pad. I always \"Meh', I don't care\" about them, but now i've got it, I really wish laptops had them, maybe they could focus around the F key being a 5, so you can blindly use it? I'm not sure.\nI totally adore this keyboard, along with it's little sister the K380."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is a fantastic keyboard.  I have replaced my really old Logitech G11 with this and difference is huge.  My old keyboard was a gaming type, with traditional raised keys. This low profile keyboard is so much better.\nI have found that typing is so much easier on this. The keys are really well spaced out, and typing is just a pleasure now; no more hammering on the keyboard.  The keys have a great feel when depressed.\nThe keyboard also looks really nice.  I didn't really buy it for the phone/tablet stand - but it does work well.  I got it purely cos it was the best looking keyboard Logitech make at the moment - I think - plus it had really good reviews.\nIt has taken a few days to adjust to some of the key placements; some keys are in slightly different positions than they were on my old keyboard, but that will probably be a similar problem when moving between most keyboards.\nThe Logitech Options software is very good to.  It is quick to load, easy to use.  It also works with a Logitech mouse, so you can customise both with one piece of software.  I've paired my K780 with a M720 Triathlon mouse.\nAll in all, this is a good buy"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Good quality and workls well once you have worked out how to use it.\nBut, as with ALL Logitech products I have purchased, their user instructions and on-line help is more than useless.  I have by trial and error solved the issues I had but, having firstly asked Logitech for help by email.  I've received replies sometimes 5 weeks later.  Pointing this out to them was a complete and utter waste of time and effort.\nIt's about time they got their act together and backed up their products with a decent support system."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Funny thing is that I am using this keyboard to type this. I was decent on first use I didn't see any problems. Its been less that a week and I have noticed a few issues. The response time can be very slow at times. Sometimes it will disconnect but give the impression that it is still connected. Both shift keys do not work on first use. I usually hold the shift key and left mouse button to select a few items. I thought this was a one off but I realise its the keyboard which doesn't respond the first time I try and select many items this is annoying because I assume it will select everything but it rather deselects the first option and select the new one."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"My problem, running two laptops in a three screen set up. Typing on an angle gave me shoulder ache and using a cheap wireless keyboard in the centre was horrible and only ran one of the laptops.\nSolution: This fantastic bit of kit, the K780. I was a bit wary of buying an 'expensive' keyboard without trying it but it has a great feel and is as good as my benchmark keyboard on the Dell 1525. The keystrokes are short, positive and silent but the keyboard is so slim and solidly constructed (I think it might be solid aluminium) that the key impact noise transfers through to the desk instead. I would recommend something like a rubber mouse mat underneath to completely kill the noise.\nI love this keyboard for its round keys which are very easy to hit correctly and for the ease of switching between laptops. I have one laptop on wireless using the dongle, the other on Bluetooth. I did set up the third channel for my mobile by Bluetooth but it doesn't save much time as most mobile operations are pressing or swiping, it might be useful if you were blogging or doing something that involved a long tying session. I also bought a Logitech switchable mouse, again one laptop wireless via dongle, the other via Bluetooth. The downloaded software detected two receiver dongles and asked if I wanted to combine them onto one which it then did for me. Very easy and freed up a USB port.\nSolid recommendation. One possible downside is the width of the 'gutter' to support a phone or tablet, I think this is only about 11mm and my slim Huawei only just fits when it is in a case. Not a problem for me as I don't use it but if this a reason for buying then beware."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I am converting my desk space with a MacBook and external monitor (through USB-C) so needed a new keyboard. I was looking at the Magic Keyboard but wanted to look for alternatives first. This keyboard ticks many boxes:\nTyping Experience: The keyboard is quiet, comfortable and accurate. It has a reasonable amount of depth in key presses and the spacing between the keys is good. The rounded design of the keys seems to provide some added assurance for accurate typing (albeit it may be psychological).\nDesign: It looks good and has bit of weight due to the back panel which supports a tablet/phone. It doesn't shift around on the desk and the black/white contrast is fine with a granite style design. No back lighting but not really a big deal as the model offering that feature is over x3 the price! Also has a num-pad which was needed.\nMulti-Device: I can't comment on the functionality as I have yet to use this with another PC or operating system but the setup on the Mac was straight forward to connect via Bluetooth.\nFunctions: Most Mac specific shortcuts are available although you may need to go through the online guide to find some more obscure options such as adjusting the brightness of the screen via the keyboard. Logitech options gives you a little bit more functionality. For example, there is no caps lock indicator on the keyboard or on screen but this can be made available via the software.\nFor the price, I do not have any major complaints except it would have been nice to have some height adjustment to raise the keyboard."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Have had this keyboard for about a month now - the circular keys do take a bit of getting used to but are crisp and positive in action - the build quality appears excellent - a really solid (and surprisingly heavy) piece of desk furniture.\nReally enjoy that I can switch from iPad to PC at the press of a button, and its a feature which seems to work very reliably so far - not sure how long I should expect batteries to last, but no issues thus far. In fact the only \"difficulty\" I've had relates to the fact that I find myself pressing the caps lock key by mistake as its pretty close to the A and slightly offset compared to a standard keyboard. Assuming it continues to perform as it does at present I suspect that this is something that I'll simply need to get used to and train myself out of"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Really liking using this keyboard at the moment. Once bluetooth-paired I can work type across my laptop, iPad and iPhone switching between them at the touch of a button. Keyboard is a satisfying width, not too narrow or bunching for the fingers. Great soft touch, low noise keys that still feel sturdy and robust. It's quite weighty and so doesn't shunt around - not so great for being portable, though. Batteries seem to be holding out at the moment. Have only used the 'lip' for resting a device in a little but it seems ok. You'd have to take a phone or pad out of any but the thinnest protective covers you may have on it to fit in."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I've been using this keyboard between two computers for a few weeks now and I'm really enjoying using it.  The keys are nice and quiet and I'm able to type quickly and accurately.  The keyboard is very nicely made and has some weight to it which means it doesn't go walkabout on the desk.\nThe only thing I would like changed is that, for me, I'd prefer there to be more rake on the keyboard.  By rake I mean I'd like it to be slightly higher at the back so it slopes down to the front more but otherwise it's great."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Logitech has replaced the Function keys with  a set of Multimedia keys - and there is no keyboard combination to switch that back to normal behaviour! Unless you install the Logitech Options software on every machine you are using (smart idea for a multi device keyboard... and not feasible on a computer at work where you can't install your own software) you always have to press the Fn key to close a window. Aaaargh!\nWhy can't Logitech accept this is just a keyboard? It has to work standalone without having to install software on the computer.\nUPDATE: Since the last update, the Logitech Options software permanently consumes between 0.5 and 1.5% CPU (i.e. burns a lot of battery on a tablet). The Logitech website says it is possible to switch the behaviour to normal by pressing Fn-ESC for 3 sec, but that does not work either. Basically, Logitech has made itself completely useless for the office market. :-((("},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This fairly compact-sized keyboard is quite heavy and the build quality is excellent. The full-sized number pad is a nice addition. The typing is very easy and comfortable the oval chiclet-style keys have brilliant plunge and travel. Has an excellent software for Windows also fully compatible with Chrome OS as well (all the media keys, volume, etc. working perfectly). I am big fan of the fab ThinkPad keyboards but this is the best Keyboard I have ever had. Well done Logitech!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I just received this a week now and it is awesome. It works perfectly with Windows PC and iPhone and iPad. Very nice support and special keys for both OSs. Also plays very nice with a Logitech MX Mouse. Yes it is a bit pricey but keep in mind you are not buying just a keyboard you are also buying the software that comes with it that is one of the best things I have ever installed. It also gives me the ability to map certain keys to do different tasks in different software. If you are a productivity freek than this is the keyboard for you"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Easy to use and very easy to setup.  Don't know about battery life but with auto power down and standard batteries I'm not expecting an issue.  The built in holder holds both my 12.9 ipad pro and my iPhone 8 plus with their cases.  Comfortable to type on (I am not a touch typist).  This keyboard has really made my laptop much more ergonomic.  Build quality is great."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Overall very impressed but for one aspect of the design.\nI was initially going to return this product as I cannot fit my IPad into the slot when in it’s folio case. Given it is an ultra thin 5.9mm IPAD Pro, with the slimmest case available, this is a surprise but to be fair the slot size dimensions are provided on Logitech’s website and accurate (11.3mm). My IPhone 6 in apple leather case does fit albeit the case slightly makes the phone sit at a slightly steeper but still very useable.\nHowever, I was blown away but how comfortable the keyboard is to use. The touch is fantastic and instantly has improved my productivity. Looking at it out of the box I thought they key travel was too small but as soon as you use it for real it is perfect.\nIt is a really nice size for desktop use and good weight to support any devices you put into the slot. However I would therefore say it is not good to be carried around on a regular basis but more for moving between desktop work areas.\nThe Bluetooth pairing and subsequent device switching functionality is very well implemented, although bear in mind if you are setting up a workspace and switching between a PC and IPAD that a mouse will not work with an IPAD.\nIf Logitech revise this product it would be great if the slot size was bigger to accommodate cased products, or maybe adjustable, and then I could give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is the wireless keyboard I was waiting for. All works really well, it's well designed, the round keys have a nice feel and texture, they are also pretty silent in comparison with my wireless HP keyboard which keys were of the standard noisy shape with the disadvantage to trap a lot of dirt and frequently became unresponsive to strokes or suddenly decided to type a lot of the same letters uncontrollably becoming very irritating. This new K780 keyboard is just perfection for me and it has the advantage to be rather weighty chiefly to accommodate the weights of a tablet and a phone on its rear support. But it's also smaller than a standard keyboard but designed in such a way that you don't lose the right-hand number pad which often disappear with smaller keyboards. Logitech has enclosed a step-by-step schematic that made it very easy to set-up. Typing has now become more pleasurable and if you're after a well designed and well made keyboard, go for it, a great value product."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is the first time I've spent anything more than the minimum amount on a mouse or keyboard.  I have 2 laptops that I use for work and home, and am constantly switching dongles between the two to share a wireless keyboard and mouse.  So I decided to invest in the Logitech MX Anywhere 2 mouse and this keyboard.  Both laptops work on Windows 10, and the set up was incredibly easy.  I just searched on my laptop for Bluetooth settings, and both the keyboard and mouse were immediately discovered.  I just clicked \"pair\" for each product and the mouse instantly paired.  The keyboard just needed a code inputting before it also paired.  I then did this on my second laptop.\nI was a little worried that the keyboard would be a bit small as some of the reviews mention it being a travel keyboard, whereas I wanted it for permanent use at my desk, but I needn't have worried.  It is heavier and does take up less space than my older wireless keyboard, but I haven't had any problems typing on it.  The keys are lovely to press and if anything I seem to have been typing more accurately.  There is a separate number pad that is in a comfortable position.  A few of the keys are placed in slightly different positions, but that is just a matter of getting used to reaching to slightly different places.  The keyboard switches instantly to my other laptop when one of the channels is selected.  I won't be using it for gaming so cannot comment on its suitability for that, but for office work I couldn't recommend it more highly.  All in all I can now see why people spend a little more to get a good mouse and keyboard."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought this to allow me to be able to type on all of my devices while away from my desk.\nThe keyboard has a slot for a ipad,tablet so you can in effect turn your ipad/tablet into a mini pc and quite happily type at a normal rate instead of tapping on a mobile keyboard.\nThe only small gripe is the the setup the timeout for entering the code is a little quick but i managed it and i am blind.\nThe other is the weight of the keyboard but then you need a solid platform to work from to give you the feel of a desktop keyboard.\nVery happy and i use it daily  to give me the freedom to get away from the desk while keeping the speed of response up.\nI would recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Once used to circular buttons found this keyboard to be excellent. Good responsive keys. Only downside is keys not back-lit. On/off switch is a nice touch as it is not re-chargable"},{"rating":"2.0","content":"I used it as my main office keyboard. The keyboard function works as I expected. Noiseless and smooth. However, I used Huawei P20 Pro with a case. I cannot use the keyboard as a stand to support my phone as the gap is too narrow to put the phone in.  It's a shame really. Also, if you have a phone with front fingerprint unlock button. I strongly recommend you do not use this keyboard as everytime you unlock your phone, you have to lift your phone. It works great if it's FaceID unlock."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"What a good keyboard. The ONLY problem i have with it is the lack of backlit keys - for the price i think it's rather silly of Logitech to NOT include this functionality in such an expensive input device in this day and age."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I really like this keyboard and would recomend it to anybody. The design looks great and the round keys are really nice to type on with some really nice clicky key switches that arn’t too loud. My favourite feature apart from the keys is that i can easily switch between my MacBook Pro and my iPad Pro 9.7 which sits nicely in the device stand at the perfect viewing angle. I really like using my iPad with a keyboard more than i thought i would. I just wish it was backlit for typing at night but the battery is suppose to last 18 - 24 months which is great."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"At first sight I really enjoyed being able to stand my phone up on this keyboard, but after a while of the plastic rubbing against my phone, the novelty wore off. It would have been far better for me to have just bought a phone cradle that could also charge my phone.\nDespite the damage this thing caused, I could overlook that if the keyboard actually worked. I'd find myself constantly turning it off and on in hopes that my keystrokes would be picked up. I'd be hitting the same key over and over, yet nothing would happen. Perhaps I got a faulty one, I can't be sure and I'm not willing to find out."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I was given a Logitech K780 in the office to use along with a tablet and I liked it so much, I purchased one for my home office too.\nI was amazed on how quickly I became used to the typing experience on this keyboard.
