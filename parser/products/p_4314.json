I originally plumped for the AKG K550's based on rave reviews and my experience with my 451's - great clarity but overall I was really disappointed with them due to lack of bass and they just didn't go loud enough unless they were being powered off an amp. I went out and tried as many different brands as possible, but nothing was ticking my boxes except for a set of TMA- 1's owned by a friend, so I went for the TMA-2's and I'm really happy with them. I got them an hour ago and have found them really hard to put down, going through all genres of music to test them in all areas. Their balance of punchy, yet warm bass and beautifully clear and wide soundstage is fantastic. I know that my taste may not be to others, as how one man wants his music to sound may not be the case for another, but in my humble view these are amazing!!"},{"rating":"1.0","content":"I love neural sound. If the producer intended for heavy bass in a track then I would hope that my sound equipment would replicate that as close as possible. The TMA 2 studio preset is very far off effective sound reproduction. The bass is horribly muddy and loose. Everything sounded terrible. All types of music were way off. I wanted to love these headphones. The physical design is fantastic but the sound is shocking. Maybe I got a faulty pair, but both ears sounded the same.\nI sent them back."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Amazing modular concept. Great clear and powerful sound suitable to all style of music. Would have been great ,as an option, to come with all the ear pads included (at a discounted price) because each ear pad type does really transform the listening experience and comfort and they aren't that cheap to buy separately (I bought 3 pairs so far it's starting to add up...).  Other things to consider: The cans are flexible in all directions and sit well on (or around) your ears but they don't fold or swivel (like dJ classic headphone), the product is really tough but I wouldn't say indestructible either (essentially high grade plastic with a great rubberised finish that will probably get superficially scratched with time and use -personally I don't mind it but it might put off those who want their stuff to remain pristine for eternity- , they are also a bit \"clampy\" on the head so if you have a large head you should try them before buying and choose the ear pads option wisely (having said that those coming with the guru set are probably the most comfortable). More on the sound: The S04 are very sharp neodynium drivers with good tight and warm bass (not overwhelming) and a relatively flat response overall out of the box (which is a good thing unless you are a bass head I guess) and you don't need and amp to drive them. Finally the modularity of this kit means that if a better drivers (or one with a different signature) is being released in the future (on top of the existing range) you can easily buy them and swap them for a lot less than buying whole new pair of headphones, so again hat down to AIAIA for pioneering this concept, it's fun and most importantly it works very well."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Great headphones for DJing. The HD25 is obviously the main competition:\n+s\n- For me, they're more comfortable\n- Better isolation when needed\n- More punch\n- Look cooler\n-s\n- Sound is not as neutral. Mids aren't quite as clear, and the low end is slightly over-emphasised. I'm pretty sure mine are broken in now. Might be a problem if you like mixing with your headphones on vs. using the club system/booth monitors.\n- Not as modular as the HD25s."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I am not a pro although I have been in the audio world through AV work and then hobby audio and music stuff. I wanted a good pair of headphones having had the same pair for years. I was looking at reviews and comments and these kept coming up and the price was in a range of being high enough to fit the you get what you pay for bill but not brake the bank. The modular aspect is a bonus as replacement parts is cheaper than buying a new pair. The first day of using them I heard things that I could never have heard before using any of the equipment I have. Brilliant and stylish"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Went for the studio preset and I wasn't disappointed at all. Out of the box these things sound great and once they've been broken in a bit there is nothing at this price mark that comes close. I've tried a few of the different presets now and this is definitely the stand out one for me."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"What an excellent pair of headphones, I have purchased many headphones in my time as a sound engineer but these are by far the best. They‚Äôre about as close to having the ability to mix (accurately) on the move. Much prefer these over the DT 990‚Äôs and other models"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"A present for y grandson, and he is delighted."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great for sound recording or critical listening.

They sound amazing"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Best headphones üëåüèº"},{"rating":"2.0","content":"Let me start with the good. The look is great, the minimalist style really appeals to me and they look like a quality set of headphones. But they aren't without their problems.\nI bought these for casual home and office use. I was interested as the sound profile isn't a flat response. I've had headphones like this in the past on the advice of headfi forums but I find this sound profile a tad boring. These Young Guru's are bass boosted a tad and so is the treble; but not to the detriment of the sound. In fact if you are listening for the enjoyment of music (rather than for the analytical studio based scenario) this slight V shaped curve really adds some punch to the music, as you might expect from the E04 speaker unit's vibrant definition. The clarity doesn't suffer for this and most genres of music - particularly electronic and dance music sound excellent and most of all enjoyable.\nOn sound alone it'd be 5 stars. But unfortunately it's let down by sub standard build quality. I'm currently on my second pair as my first set had a speaker die within the first week. Manufacturing defects are a fact of life, but on receiving my new set (delivered before my current set was returned thanks to Amazon's excellent customer service) I noticed that the microfiber cloth that goes around the ear piece was glued in a way that meant it wouldn't create a secure seal over the speaker. The result was that the sound stage felt firmly biased to one ear. If you press hard enough it would secure itself but I've already bought the low profile on ear leatherette ear pieces for on the go use and the modularity of the unit is essential to me. My previous (defective) set did not have this issue.\nIts a real disappointment that I've received 2 defective products as I do love the sound of these headphones. Luckily I have received my new pair before I sent the old ones back so I'm able to mix and match the defective unit's ear pads with my newer one to have a functional set of headphones.\nWith my experience and given that the cost is ~¬£160 the finish should be much higher than I experienced. I'm going to see what the longevity is like and will update the review accordingly.\nI'd suggest that you buy with caution."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"AIAIAI TMA-2 - Studio Preset = Pure quality sound for the ones for who are not keen for high/strong bass, completely isolating, confy and deep sound especially for live recorded music; my only concern is about the temperature that you ears could have with long exposures it may become frustrating, but for the rest, just perfect for this price."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"Received the item today, opened the plain amazon box to find the dirty thrown-about looking TMA2 box. Took ages to figure out how to open the packaging, once inside, I pieced it together until I noticed one of the speakers rattling, I tried the headphones for audio quality and luckily the rattling didn't have anything to do with the audio delivery. However I'd probably refrain from calling these studio headphones as the audio quality sounds very saturated for a studio headphone. The material on the headphones also gets marked easily with sweat and in a day or two I can expect them to have some permanent markings on them which totally ruins a product that has such simplistic design. I'm very disappointed for ¬£180 or whatever it was, I was expecting something A LOT better. The headphone lead is also quite heavy which creates an imbalance for the headphones. The build quality is decent, it's just there's a lot of flaws with this product. When driving these headphones moderately loudly they also begin to distort too."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Bass heavy, but that's perfect for me. Good construction, long cable, really good."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I love this product, its comfortable, it feels expensive, the sound is incredible and better than any headphones I have tried previously. The modular design makes these headphones really innovative and unique to standard headphones. I have to repeat again , the sound they produce is truly incredible and very detailed. The bass is a bit too strong on them, but if you have an amplifier to further improve the experience its not a problem (with slightly reduced bass even better!).\nIt only takes a second for the listener to fall in love with these headphones, as they notice when a member of the orchestra (considering you are listening to classical music like Rachmaninov for example) takes a breath in synchrony with the next musical note...or for the next string to be hit on the guitar by the likes of Jimmy Page from Led Zeppelin. Yes that is how detailed and vibrant the sound is from these headphones... Truly awesome headphones, not worth wasting them on listening on mobile devices though, I would suggest getting some lossless .flac music files or buying musical CD's to listen to with these."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"After having Sennheiser's for DJ use over the past 7 years I fancied a change and went for the AIAIAI DJ Preset and I'm glad I did. I've only had these since today and breaking them in gently as advised to in the box for 24hrs and so far I'm very impressed. The packaging of the headphones is great and feel like you're unwrapping something pretty special. Putting the pieces together is straightforward and I love the look and feel of the product, they just feel well made. SO far a very happy customer and super quick delivery from Amazon :)"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"My first pair of good quality headphones and I'm never going back. The sound is extremely clear and immersive, and they're really comfortable. Extremely well priced compared to other top end headphones and the fact that you can change parts and upgrade them makes them even more fun, adaptable and cost effective. I upgraded mine with the H05 wireless headband and microfibre over ear pads too. The pads are extremely comfy and give great sound delivery and the wireless headband is fantastic, easy to use, works well, doesn't look too thick or chunky as in the photos and has great battery life.\nLove aiaiai and the awesome/innovative products they keeping making!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I've owned a lot of headphones over the years, and they all break fairly quickly, aren't all that comfortable, and don't sound great. These are the antithesis of pretty much all of the other headphones available. They sound amazing, they're very comfortable, and I can't overstate how durable they are. Living in London I sometimes see other people with a pair of AIAIAI's, and they're always very well-worn, but still going strong. I once left my pair outside my house overnight when it had been raining, I obviously thought they were dead to the world, but lo and behold they were absolutely fine.\nYou won't regret buying them, they are amazing.
