In hindsight, while I'm over the moon about the 50% savings, I should have just bought it. Comfort wise it's perfect, I don't have overly large hands, probably about average for a man, but this mouse just fits like a glove. I have been running a mouse that cost 16 pounds in 2013, and have been reluctant to change because I just couldn't seem to find anything as comfy, this is equally as or more, and the more premium feel and weight makes it better too. Bluetooth has worked flawlessly, and the Quick Switch feature has done the same switching from a Windows desktop to Apple laptop almost instantly. Tracking is precise and the buttons feel great. Came charged, but will be charging a bit overnight and seeing how long that lasts, not had any issues yet though. The scroll wheel is something I'll get used to, however it us very different from anything I've used before, louder too. The thumb scroll was invaluable to me as an video editor, allowing me to scrub the timeline with that, making it a breeze.

Default settings are press it down to show all applications open to allow quick switching between applications (same as pressing \"Windows Key & Tab\" in Windows), but hold it down and drag mouse down to minimise everything and show desktop (there are also pre-configured gestures for left, right and up).  All the defaults are useful, but using the downloaded software you can configure all the buttons and gestures to do nearly anything!  What a revelation!\nThe thumb wheel feels quality, there is a little resistance to it since it feels quite nicely heavy, but I think this gives greater control.  Unfortunately I don't have to scroll sideways too often, but if you do you should find it very satisfying to use!\nAll in all it's a very comfy mouse for people like me with slightly larger hands, although I don't know how well smaller-handed people would get on with it!  It is the largest mouse I'v ever owned. I do love the thumb rest (including the gesture button) and the way the whole mouse (the usual 2 mouse buttons at least) slants down to the right like most good ergonomic mice.  My only gripe is that there is nowhere to rest your ring and little fingers if you use your first and middle fingers to operate the usual 2 mouse buttons!  They just have to kind of dangle down by the side, ever so slightly uncomfortably.  If you use your middle finger to operate the scroll wheel and your right-hand ring finger to operate the right mouse button it is more comfortable, but I would have liked a dint or something to rest my ring and little fingers.\nConsidering the quality and all of the other benefits of this mouse the complaint is a relatively minor one, but one that stops me giving it the full 5 stars.\nAll in all it's a pleasure to use and if you've only ever used cheapish mice before you will almost certainly not regret upgrading to this beast!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"As cliche as it sounds, this is one of the best computer mice I have ever had the pleasure of using.\nThe ergonomics are astounding and suitable for anyone with a Medium to Large glove size.

It comes with a standard Logitech wireless dongle, but operates just fine with the built in Bluetooth that most modern computers come equipped with, which is great if USB ports are at a premium to you!\nWhen you connect to a computer you also get the option to install some Logitech management software to fine tune the mouse. Essentially it gives you total control over the DPI, smooth scrolling and even whether you want the middle scroll-wheel to feel like a ratchet (feel the clicks as you scroll) or feel like a flywheel (smooth-as-silk scrolling that carries on effortlessly).\nOverall, if you want a sturdy, comfortable mouse that isn't made of  ridiculously cheap materials, THIS is the one for you!"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I've been considering purchasing the MX Master for a while as I use my PC for variety of things with a mix of productivity and occaisional FPS and RPG gaming.

Boy, I know I missed a lot, because this mouse is definitely the best mouse one can buy for productivity. The way your palm rest on the MX Master, you will never get cramps from using a mouse again, it is perfectly designed to be used for long periods of time.\nThe extra buttons it has can also be customized through the Logitech software which cane be installed on your MacBook or PC, which will boost your productivity and saves you time in switching between apps etc.\nThe scroll button is another amazing piece of tech, it has some sort of 'gear' that can be changed to your liking by pressing a button. It can be set to scroll fast or at a more accurate scrolling, according to your needs.\nCan't recommend this mouse enough! I can say that I will never use my Apple Magic mouse again :/"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"GENERAL\nA very ergonomic mouse - fit's perfectly in my average sized hand. The buttons (left/right) are very responsive with a good feel.\nBUTTONS\nThere are 2/3 extra buttons. Behind the side-scroll wheel is a '2 button' element for back and forward thru pages. More discreet and easy to miss is the button under the thumb-rest. This can be programmed to do any number of things. I keep my software environment simple so have not installed the logitech software. So I can't speak for the use of these buttons, but I can say they are easily reached and responsive.\nSCROLL WHEEL\nSome hate it but I love the 'flywheel' scroll - it's one of the main reasons I stuck with Logitech (from owning an m500). Previously you had 'free wheel' which spins for ages and scrolls through many pages of documents/web etc. Or 'normal' scroll, with a notched 'click' response as you roll the wheel. With this MX Master, the 'normal' notched scroll remains, but if you flick the wheel in this mode it 'unlocks' and spins. Tap the wheel again and it 'locks' again so scrolling stops. Very clever and useful. Press the button behind the scroll wheel and it goes into 'always free' fast and frictionless spin - which is where I have it 90% of the time.\nSIDE SCROLL\nI use it for web dev and graphic design, so side-scroll was also important.  Sadly the mouse falls a bit short here. The thumb wheel doesn't project far and I find my thumb simply slips over it - it doesn't turn at all. I need to 'pinch', so end up clicking the left button when I don't want to. Or I have to move my thumb back and 'point inwards' to gain any purchase on the wheel - very awkward, making it easier just to go back to keyboard/mouse combinations. If the side scroll had a 'loose flywheel' setting this mouse would be perfect.\nSURFACES\nFor sensitivity it's very good - works on any surface as it promises. Being wireless the DPI will never be amazing, but it's accurate enough for me and adjustable without additional software.\nCHARGE\nI love that it can charge while in use, so no down-time. Not had it long, but I'm 3 days in on one charge.\nCONNECTING\nYou get a receiver for wireless. Unfortunately nowhere to store it. My other Logitech has a slot to keep it safe. Now I have a tiny component and nowhere to put it.\nI'm using bluetooth to a MAC. It connected first time and has had no issues, no drop-outs. One small point is that the manual says to press the 'connect' button - but there isn't one. Just turn it on and it connects on its own.\nYou can connect to 3 devices, with a button to cycle through the devices on the base of the mouse.\nSUMMARY\nThis is a very comfortable mouse I'm very happy with. A little work on the side-scroll and it would get 5 stars. It's not a gaming mouse, not enough buttons, but is very much a designers or 'all day on the PC' person's mouse."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I do like Logitech pointing devices. I have several of their mice and trackballs. This mouse works very well. I like the extra buttons on it and the scroll wheel in particular - being able to switch it from free-running to notched is great. Being able to connect to multiple devices is a great feature, I have the supplied wireless dongle attached to my desktop PC and I also have it paired over bluetooth to my laptop - a press on the button on the bottom switches between them. Having a power switch on the bottom is useful too, being able to switch is off is handy both for putting it in the laptop bag, and during cleaning.\nThe size of it is comfortable in my hand, although there's nowhere for my two smallest fingers to really go. The buttons are a bit loud too, quieter switches would make this a better product."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought the 'AMZ' variant of this MX Master, with the additional benefit of a 40% cyber monday saving, to replace a well-used Performance MX which had developed an intermittent 'link' issue with its usb-only unifying device.\nI had bought the original MX Master a year or so ago, to use with a new iMac, and found it very easy to setup, using bluetooth, very responsive, and infinitely more comfortable than the appalling Apple Mouse.

Not had it long, but I'm 3 days in on one charge.\nCONNECTING\nYou get a receiver for wireless. Unfortunately nowhere to store it. My other Logitech has a slot to keep it safe. Now I have a tiny component and nowhere to put it.\nI'm using bluetooth to a MAC. It connected first time and has had no issues, no drop-outs. One small point is that the manual says to press the 'connect' button - but there isn't one. Just turn it on and it connects on its own.\nYou can connect to 3 devices, with a button to cycle through the devices on the base of the mouse.\nSUMMARY\nThis is a very comfortable mouse I'm very happy with. A little work on the side-scroll and it would get 5 stars. It's not a gaming mouse, not enough buttons, but is very much a designers or 'all day on the PC' person's mouse."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I do like Logitech pointing devices. I have several of their mice and trackballs. This mouse works very well. I like the extra buttons on it and the scroll wheel in particular - being able to switch it from free-running to notched is great. Being able to connect to multiple devices is a great feature, I have the supplied wireless dongle attached to my desktop PC and I also have it paired over bluetooth to my laptop - a press on the button on the bottom switches between them. Having a power switch on the bottom is useful too, being able to switch is off is handy both for putting it in the laptop bag, and during cleaning.\nThe size of it is comfortable in my hand, although there's nowhere for my two smallest fingers to really go. The buttons are a bit loud too, quieter switches would make this a better product."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought the 'AMZ' variant of this MX Master, with the additional benefit of a 40% cyber monday saving, to replace a well-used Performance MX which had developed an intermittent 'link' issue with its usb-only unifying device.\nI had bought the original MX Master a year or so ago, to use with a new iMac, and found it very easy to setup, using bluetooth, very responsive, and infinitely more comfortable than the appalling Apple Mouse. It also has a better rechargeable internal battery, using a standard mini-usb cable.\nThis 'AMZ' variant is exactly the same, the difference appears to be solely in the much simpler packaging, for a 10% lower standard price. You do need to download the 'Logitech Options' software, if you want to change some of the mouse's features. I just changed the scroll wheel to the 'freewheeling' mode, the rest is fine for me. Compared to the older Performance MX, I find the MX Master a bit lighter, and more comfortable to use for lengthy periods."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Picked this up for 40 pounds during Cyber Monday, but have been wanting this mouse for months and couldn't quite justify the 80 pound RRP. In hindsight, while I'm over the moon about the 50% savings, I should have just bought it. Comfort wise it's perfect, I don't have overly large hands, probably about average for a man, but this mouse just fits like a glove. I have been running a mouse that cost 16 pounds in 2013, and have been reluctant to change because I just couldn't seem to find anything as comfy, this is equally as or more, and the more premium feel and weight makes it better too. Bluetooth has worked flawlessly, and the Quick Switch feature has done the same switching from a Windows desktop to Apple laptop almost instantly. Tracking is precise and the buttons feel great. Came charged, but will be charging a bit overnight and seeing how long that lasts, not had any issues yet though. The scroll wheel is something I'll get used to, however it us very different from anything I've used before, louder too. The thumb scroll was invaluable to me as an video editor, allowing me to scrub the timeline with that, making it a breeze. Don't really use gestures on Windows but the gesture button has been helpful on the Macbook. All in all, just get it if you've been wondering, it looks great, feels great, and works great, what more can you want."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"This mouse is truly a pleasure to use - as long as you're right-handed!\nThe free-wheel scroll wheel is a revelation for someone who's work involves scrolling through long pages of computer code all day, just give it a strong flick and it instantly unlocks from the usual \"notches\" to free-wheeling, speeding up / down whole pages in no time.\nAlso I wasn't expecting the gesture button to be as useful as it is!  Default settings are press it down to show all applications open to allow quick switching between applications (same as pressing \"Windows Key & Tab\" in Windows), but hold it down and drag mouse down to minimise everything and show desktop (there are also pre-configured gestures for left, right and up).  All the defaults are useful, but using the downloaded software you can configure all the buttons and gestures to do nearly anything!  What a revelation!\nThe thumb wheel feels quality, there is a little resistance to it since it feels quite nicely heavy, but I think this gives greater control.  Unfortunately I don't have to scroll sideways too often, but if you do you should find it very satisfying to use!\nAll in all it's a very comfy mouse for people like me with slightly larger hands, although I don't know how well smaller-handed people would get on with it!  It is the largest mouse I'v ever owned. I do love the thumb rest (including the gesture button) and the way the whole mouse (the usual 2 mouse buttons at least) slants down to the right like most good ergonomic mice.  My only gripe is that there is nowhere to rest your ring and little fingers if you use your first and middle fingers to operate the usual 2 mouse buttons!  They just have to kind of dangle down by the side, ever so slightly uncomfortably.  If you use your middle finger to operate the scroll wheel and your right-hand ring finger to operate the right mouse button it is more comfortable, but I would have liked a dint or something to rest my ring and little fingers.\nConsidering the quality and all of the other benefits of this mouse the complaint is a relatively minor one, but one that stops me giving it the full 5 stars.\nAll in all it's a pleasure to use and if you've only ever used cheapish mice before you will almost certainly not regret upgrading to this beast!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"As cliche as it sounds, this is one of the best computer mice I have ever had the pleasure of using.\nThe ergonomics are astounding and suitable for anyone with a Medium to Large glove size. The body profile is quite steep, so anyone with particularly small hands might start to get fatigue in their wrist and forearm quite quickly. The buttons are beautifully recessed with the body and have smooth actions.\nTo conserve power you can manually turn the mouse off, as well as switch between one of three connected Bluetooth devices. It comes with a standard Logitech wireless dongle, but operates just fine with the built in Bluetooth that most modern computers come equipped with, which is great if USB ports are at a premium to you!\nWhen you connect to a computer you also get the option to install some Logitech management software to fine tune the mouse. Essentially it gives you total control over the DPI, smooth scrolling and even whether you want the middle scroll-wheel to feel like a ratchet (feel the clicks as you scroll) or feel like a flywheel (smooth-as-silk scrolling that carries on effortlessly).\nOverall, if you want a sturdy, comfortable mouse that isn't made of  ridiculously cheap materials, THIS is the one for you!"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I've been considering purchasing the MX Master for a while as I use my PC for variety of things with a mix of productivity and occaisional FPS and RPG gaming. I saw the AMZ (Amazon) version of the Logitech MX mouse for an absolute bargain on a Black Friday/Cyber Monday deal and simply couldn't resist.\nThe Amazon version of the product comes in a small carboard box with simply the basics inside to get you up and running. Like many products these days it doesn't come with any software so you need to download it manually. Fortunately with Windows 10 the 'Logitech Options' software installed automatically. However, as other people have pointed out the software is very much lacking in 'Options'.\nI find the position of the thumb buttons too far back for me to comfortably use them so it's likely I won't use those. The applications I use for productivity, i.e. Visual Studio and PowerShell Studio won't benefit much from the thumb scroll wheel. I could see that content creators using Adobe products will probably benefit from it quite heavily though. I thought I could possible repurpose the thumb wheel to provide other functionality but unfortunately the Logitech Options software gives you very few options to chose from.\nI used the mouse for a few days and whilst I really like some elements of it, it really is a terrible mouse for any kind of FPS or RPG gaming. I don't use lots of other mouse buttons when I do play games, just the regular left, right and middle + the wheel suffice for me. However, the tracking speed of this mouse is very slow, even on full speed, and occaisionally the pointer jumps when moving very slowly which is also a problem for games.\nI didn't buy this mouse for gaming, in fact, far from it, but it has made what little game playing I do very frustrating and therefore I don't think it's the right mouse for me.\nPros:\n- The AMZ 'Amazon' version is great value for money\n- Decent build quality\n- Excellent battery life\n- Both Bluetooth and Logitech Unifying receiver connectivity\n- Can be connected to mulitple devices\n- Ratchet/Free spin mouse wheel is a great feature\n- Works on pretty much any surface\nCons:\n- It's definitely NOT for gaming as the pointer speed is far too slow for gaming, even on max speed and occaisionally jumps about when moving very slowly\n- Position of thumb buttons makes them difficult to use for my hands\n- Middle mouse button can be difficult to press without activating the wheel movement\n- Very limited configuration options available with the 'Logitech Options' software\n- Nowhere on/inside the mouse to store the Logitech Unifying receiver which could be easily be misplaced\n- No charging cradle so needs to be connected with a USB lead to charge"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I work on computer 9 hours a day. Needless to say, my job comes with lots of aches and pains in the places you never knew you had. I especially struggled with wrist and palm pain. Palm was aching from rubbing on the desk whenever I move my mouse around. So I went and bought myself a mouse named the best mouse in the world by tech geeks. Well, I don't know what makes this mouse so special but for me this mouse is a life saver because it eliminated my wrist and palm pain! My hand rests on it in a very comfy way and it doesn't rub on the desk. For this reason alone I agree it's the best mouse in the world and I strongly recommend it to all office workers."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"If you want a mouse that is shaped for comfort, has multiple buttons for extra controls and is both bluetooth or 2.4, then you won't find a better mouse that this - every button (apart from left/right click) can be re-mapped to be any function, including opening apps/programs, so the extra buttons become incredibly useful.\nThe only \"downside\" is that the main wheel doesn't have a rocker, but instead there is a second wheel on the side, so if you're used to rocking the wheel to the side, then it takes a little bit of use to get used to the new control method.\nFor the upsides, they far outshine any possible detriments, with the *MONTHS* long battery life (and I do mean months), the precision, connectivity to 3 possible devices, the comfort of use, and the ratchet/free spin on the wheel is a joy to use.\nOver the years I've tried many different mice, and this is by far the most comfortable, the smoothest and has an incredible battery life!\nI can't recommend this mouse highly enough!!!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I am an Apple Magic Mouse user, but after all the good reviews I read about this mouse, and even after the discount on it after Logitech released the MX Master S2, I finally made the decision to buy and test it out. Boy, I know I missed a lot, because this mouse is definitely the best mouse one can buy for productivity. The way your palm rest on the MX Master, you will never get cramps from using a mouse again, it is perfectly designed to be used for long periods of time.\nThe extra buttons it has can also be customized through the Logitech software which cane be installed on your MacBook or PC, which will boost your productivity and saves you time in switching between apps etc.\nThe scroll button is another amazing piece of tech, it has some sort of 'gear' that can be changed to your liking by pressing a button. It can be set to scroll fast or at a more accurate scrolling, according to your needs.\nCan't recommend this mouse enough! I can say that I will never use my Apple Magic mouse again :/"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"GENERAL\nA very ergonomic mouse - fit's perfectly in my average sized hand. The buttons (left/right) are very responsive with a good feel.\nBUTTONS\nThere are 2/3 extra buttons. Behind the side-scroll wheel is a '2 button' element for back and forward thru pages. More discreet and easy to miss is the button under the thumb-rest. This can be programmed to do any number of things. I keep my software environment simple so have not installed the logitech software. So I can't speak for the use of these buttons, but I can say they are easily reached and responsive.\nSCROLL WHEEL\nSome hate it but I love the 'flywheel' scroll - it's one of the main reasons I stuck with Logitech (from owning an m500). Previously you had 'free wheel' which spins for ages and scrolls through many pages of documents/web etc. Or 'normal' scroll, with a notched 'click' response as you roll the wheel. With this MX Master, the 'normal' notched scroll remains, but if you flick the wheel in this mode it 'unlocks' and spins. Tap the wheel again and it 'locks' again so scrolling stops. Very clever and useful. Press the button behind the scroll wheel and it goes into 'always free' fast and frictionless spin - which is where I have it 90% of the time.\nSIDE SCROLL\nI use it for web dev and graphic design, so side-scroll was also important.  Sadly the mouse falls a bit short here. The thumb wheel doesn't project far and I find my thumb simply slips over it - it doesn't turn at all. I need to 'pinch', so end up clicking the left button when I don't want to. Or I have to move my thumb back and 'point inwards' to gain any purchase on the wheel - very awkward, making it easier just to go back to keyboard/mouse combinations. If the side scroll had a 'loose flywheel' setting this mouse would be perfect.\nSURFACES\nFor sensitivity it's very good - works on any surface as it promises.
