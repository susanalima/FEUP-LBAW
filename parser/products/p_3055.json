They are really comfy and the sound is great.\nShe loves them - listens to radio or MP3 and answers her phone while wearing them. She can leave her phone on the table and wanders round downstairs still talking to her friends. Would recommend only if you don't want conversation with the user!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"After searching for a good cheap pair of headphones I found these, I needed something with a Mic, Wire and bluetooth options which this has, The ear part is super comfortable soft and doesn't look flimsy or cheap. The colour is beautiful also. I have very sensitive ears and in ears hurt and most overheads give me achy lobes these don't !!  The noise cancellation is Fabulous so if you suffer with misophina like me these are great. Honestly I could hype these up endlessly but I don't have time. I cannot praise these enough, speedy delivery, Good volume, Great style and they're very durable (Already been dropped by my 16 month old son!!)"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Quick delivery as I ordered it yesterday and just got it today. The seller delivered great customer service as I kept receiving updates on my order. The package came in with a pouch, instructions, usd lead and, jack lead to connect it to your phone (optional). The headphone is stylish, sleek and lightweight, suitable for anyone on the go as it is collapsable. The instructions are easy to follow. Great product would recommend it as a gift to anyone especially to music lovers."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Impressed! The sound quality is respectable for headphones of this price, and the colour is as demonstrated in the photo. They’re very cute and I’ve received lots of compliments, I shall be recommending these to friends. Moreover, the seller is friendly, replies very promptly, and their service is exceptional.\nI try not to keep them up too high volume-wise, as they can be very loud! Which I suppose is a good thing. However, a fair word of warning if you’re a student, if you keep them too loud, other people will be able to hear them, even from a short distance. Besides that, the charge time is decent, I tend to charge them while I’m using my laptop, and the cable isn’t a special one, so if you lose the provided one, you’ll be okay as long as you have a usb-micro cable."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought these according to my own priorities.  1. Needed to be affordable, 2. MP3 compatible, 3. Onboard SD card.\nThe cost was certainly appealing. Have yet to try the SD card but the Bluetooth enabled an assessment of quality. If you are after extreme fidelity then pay loads more. The FM reception was questionable and the station search was almost painful. This was low on my list of priorities. For what I wanted, it more than meets the criteria. So it gets a good rating for me. If you are worried about it lasting then I suggest you treat it with care and respect. Use as a casual music medium this is perfect. As for the battery life, no idea as it has just arrived. But I guess if you use it lots then you will need to charge it lots too. If this problem worries you then don't buy anything with batteries.\nOverall I view these as great value for money."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"I got these because I left my other pair in a taxi and needed a reasonably priced pair in a hurry. They do function, but they really are awful to deal with and overall they just feel cheap and poorly made.\nFirstly, when they are switched on a loud voice blares out 'READY TO CONNECT' / 'CONNECTED' which is pretty embarrassing if you are anywhere but home. Secondly, they hold almost no charge. The last pair I had (bought for less money than these) needed charging once every 3-4 days, even with heavy use. These need charging every single day, and even then sometimes they don't last. My commute is just under 3 hours total (I don't use them at work) and it's not uncommon for them to die before I get home. They do come with a wire to connect them to your phone, but the noise through this is so tinny and quiet it's not really worth bothering with.\nMost annoying of all, they affect my music when connected. Songs regularly skip and randomly speed up. There's nothing worse than finding yourself speeding through part of a song you were actually enjoying. Again, my last two sets of bluetooth headphones did not do this, so it isn't my phone at fault.\nI really regret buying them and now don't have the money for a better pair."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These headphones look great and the quality of sound was great.  I like the fact you can control the volume, play/pause what you're listening to, skip songs and answer the phone with the buttons on them.  Easy to turn on and connect to device, can be used with a wire also.  Found they last really well between charges."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"i was going to buy the rose gold beats after my old pair of beats broke but i got these instead. They are brilliant and have a great battery life. i work from home and it means i can walk around the house, clean etc without cables everywehre. connects to my phone immediately. Recommended them to my bf and hes got them in a different colour. Perfect for public transport travel. Super soft material over the ears."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Have two pairs of these already and they are just fine for cheap headphones.\nRecently I ordered a third pair and the default was far too loud. Tried to get an answer before I sent them back but couldn't find anything in clear English. Have ordered another pair anyway and hopefully the default setting won't blow my ear drums off !"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I absolutely love these, they look great, are comfortable to wear, charge lasts for a long time, really easy to connect via bluetooth and have brilliant sound. The radio is an added bonus but I don’t really use that function."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"For the price, these headphones are very good. Excellent sound quality, very comfortable. fm radio not brilliant. Works well with Echo dot. Good value for money."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Wow! Just wow. Sick if buying lots of headphones whilst at the gym and I can still hear music in the background. Like most reviews, these are very good.  Yes girly with the colour :)"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Amazing  value.\nSounds quality is perfect  for the price, very easy to set up on the bluetooth with minimal instructions. How long they will last, who knows, but for the price if they do this season I shall be happy.\nVery  recommend."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"These arrived in The Mail today and i am really pleased with the quality of the sound of these with the price they are! The design is metallic pastel rose gold and has no damage to it. I have autism, so i wear headphones all the time, i approve, the stereo is high quality and it is comfortable to wear. Got this as a early Christmas present :)"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Daughter seems very happy with the headphones and is pleased with the battery life and functionality -these are a fair bit cheaper than your main brands and quality is good! She loves the rose gold/pink."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Nice, works well enough. Doesn’t connect to my phone (SONY), but I think that may be more of an issue with my phone (cos I have so many issues with it) and it connects to my iPad and other phones just fine. Sound quality is good enough for the price. I mostly use it for audio books anyway."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great pair of headphones for the price ...  ready to use straight out of the box  would definitely recommend these"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Good stuff with very well sound balance,  I love it"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Much better than I expected for the price. The quality feels a bit cheap, but they do what they need to."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Love the headset. I use them for a coaching call I have every week, so the mic was tested thoroughly and there was no complaint.\nI also listen to talk via cable or bluetooth. Works flawlessly.\nIt can air with multiple devices (tried with two), so it's really perfect."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Very modest audio quality, FM radio is useless unless you keep your hand on the cans as an antenna, controls are illogical."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"They are ok 3 stars as when connected they make a buzzing sound will have to buy another pair and make a competence and send back for a refund"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great budget headset, so good that I now have 2."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"A gift for a teenager...enjoying them"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"One of my attractions to the headphones was the fact that it came with a little pouch. However when I unboxed it i found that a the pouch was not included. So I'm disappointed. Sound quality is okay but given the price, i wasn't expecting a lot"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Purchased this as a present for my niece who absolutely loves them.\nSound quality is surprisingly good and it connects easily through Bluetooth."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Really happy with my product so far! Exactly as described, and the color & quality is great. Great value for the price :)"},{"rating":"1.0","content":"It arrived broken....DON'T BUY."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Fantastic sound and great fit. Just a bit heavy on your head"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Bought for daughter.
