But the plastic isn't that 'flexible' type you get with other cheap devices, and looks as though it will stand up to household use.  There are some pretty decent feet on the laptop as well, meaning it doesn't sit exactly flush with a desktop, giving room for the device to breathe, although given the specs, I'm sure heat isn't going to be an issue.\nFor the price, the 14.1\" HD screen is very clear indeed, and although I don't like laptop keyboards myself (keys are too flat and square), my wife doesn't have an issue with it.\nOne minor gripe about the keyboard is that the enter key (a bar shape) is directly beneath the delete key, so as I am used to using an L-shaped enter key, I found myself (a touchtyper) hitting the delete button more often than not - but I'm not going to be using it, so hey!\nOn first using the product, set up was exceptionally easy, and 'Cortana' which I typically disable on Windows10 allowed me to do the entire set up by voice - this will no doubt be a godsend for those less technical people.  One issue I found during set up and when first using the device was the trackpad didn't actually operate; no amount of tapping the pad had any affect - during the set up it meant I couldn't 'privatise' all the settings for Windows but would have to do this later (on reflection I could have used the keyboard to make the choices, but did this after entering Windows).\nHowever, following some extensive Windows updates (and there were a few!), the trackpad started working again.  It is one of those trackpads, that although have a definate 'click' for the L & R buttons, is also sensitive enough for a simple 'tap' which I like.\nOne minor complaint, and I'm awaiting feedback from the seller, is that the wi-fi adaptor is a little 'iffy' when it comes to range.  I have many other laptops and they all work without incident at the other end of the house, but with this device, it barely picked up a signal unless you were within about 5 meters of the router - not a real issue - but noted that the wifi is not picking up 2.4GHz band, so might be a problem for someone with an older router.\nPros: A really cheap laptop, with a decent screen and an easy set up routine for the less initiated.\nCons: Needs to be updated immediately before everything worked.  Wi-Fi adaptor is not the most powerful.\nVerdict: If you need a laptop to browse the Internet, write documents and emails, for the price, this is well worth the purchase; stick a peice of fruit on the lid and you could almost mistake it for a Macbook (not that I like those!)."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This laptop is an excellent ,low cost , device.

Listen to the other advice on here and pick a different machine.\nEven when new, the laptop crashed repeatedly (e.g. it freezes every time Microsoft Office is opened), and persistently runs out of memory (want to have to refresh your browser mid email?). Wifi connection patchy and battery life is good when it works, but unpredictable (it can lose its wifi connection and drop battery by 20% just by opening and closing the lid). It doesn't help that it takes some 6-8 hours to charge.\nBut the worst of it is that the laptop physically began falling to pieces almost immediately. The keyboard casing has cracked and broken in several parts, the screws holding the bottom casing in place started falling out straight away and have to be repeatedly tightened. Parts of the top casing have just fallen off. Last night, the mouse pad fell out of place.\nComplete and utter unusable junk, far and away the worst laptop I've ever had.

So I saw the Fusion Laptop advertised through Amazon with opportunity to try and return if your not satisfied. It arrived well within the guide time and was very easy to set up and transfer a lot of items from my old PC. I was amazed at how quick it responds and how versatile it is, you always feel when you buy an item that is too good to be true that it won't meet your expectations, and I had envisaged that I would return the product, but I find it an excellent addition to our household. The only issues I would think is the build quality of the keyboard and touch pad, but as I use a mouse and keyboard the shouldn't be a problem, their also is a lack of HDMI socket but I won't be using this for streaming, so again it's not a problem.

They first arranged for a reboot USB stick to be sent to me, but when the USB stick got lost in the post, they arranged to pass me the files and the instructions to make my own reboot stick via OneDrive. And it worked fine. I was able to recover the laptop easily. All along the process, they have been incredibly responsive and showed a flexibility and can-do attitude that I had come to think impossible from any electronic vendor.

Ordered around 11pm on a day towards the end of September 2018, and it arrived within 2 days, which was great. Easy to set up, although it ran a little slowly, but I didn't think too much of it.\nIt's currently mid December. I have had the laptop for less than 3 months. The memory is pretty good for the price, but that's about it. It is already on it's last legs.\nI don't know exactly what I expected for less than £400, to be honest. You have to be sitting practically next to the modem to get decent wifi. The modem is at the bottom of the stairs, my office is at the top. When I sit at my desk I have 2 out of a possible 4 bars of wifi. Every time I disconnect from my network (something this laptop does a lot) the available wifi networks suddenly disappear until I turn it off and on again. The mouse is so sensitive I could have both hands on the keyboard and the mouse will still move to the middle of my previous sentence and I'll end up typing in a place I don't mean to. I've only touched it to turn it on and plug in the charger and there's a hairline crack over where the charger plugs into the device, plus I've had to ring and ask for a replacement charger already because the charger was so poorly made. And speaking of, the charge on the laptop lasts anywhere between 10 and 2 hours after being fully charged and can go from battery saver to critical battery mode in any amount of time from an hour to 5 minutes, when I am doing the exact same thing in both situations. Despite all this, I am still a student and was willing to put up with it in the name of saving money.\nBut then tonight happened. For the last week or so the screen has been flickering in various places seemingly at random. No clue why. Tonight the entire thing flickered between functional and a plain black screen several times before the laptop shut itself down. I've lost my entire coursework plan plus 300 words of my actual coursework, 14 hours before the deadline.\nI feel the need to stress again at this point that I have had this laptop for less than three months, and only use it for uni related work.\nI managed to turn it back on after leaving it alone, plugged in for a solid 10 minutes, and once it came back on I immediately came here to write this, and the screen is literally flickering as I type.\nDo not buy this laptop."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"I know it's only cheap.

I ran a speedtest on the supplied MS Edge browser and the max download speed was a measly 2bps vs 200 mps for my iphone in same spot. About 3m frrm the router. Yes 100x slower. I downloaded Google Chrome and got this to a respectable 70 mbs, but still shows it's limitations vs an iPhone even.

Its does everything u expect of it and more. Not does just deliver great performance but the visuals are as good as a top range lcd. Great product."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"The price of this laptop is amazing for what it features and eventually I think it will prove to have been a very good purchase, however, on top of all the lengthy updating that I was expecting, there were a number of bugs that needed sorting. The first issue was the graphics card that kept refusing to recognise applications.  I now realise it was the cause of some other issues to do with screen brightness as well. I managed to sort that out by going onto the Intel website and downloading the latest upgrade.\nThe next thing was that I wanted to use the HMDI port via a projector to screen films. The instruction booklet says it is an micro HMDI so I bought a micro adapter. Wrong! A total waste of money as it is, in fact, a mini HMDI, which I have now purchased as well. I have complained about that and got an apology. It still left me out of pocket.\nUsing the laptop with a projector is fiddly and there is obviously a knack in the order that the hardware is attached, but thankfully I managed to get it all working. Although the sound quality of the laptop speakers are poor, an external mini speaker works very well and I am sure that with proper speakers either directly attached or via Bluetooth, hopefully, that won't be an issue. I have not tested all the options out on that.\nOne of the biggest bugbears I have is the touch pad, which is clunky in the extreme and tends to enlarge or reduce text in an alarming and unexpected way. I have not yet worked out how to avoid that, but when using the laptop at a table I use a mouse and that works fine. On the move the touch pad is adequate. I do hate the clicking noise it makes when pressed, but am learning to live with it.\nThat is a lot of negatives, but the HD screen is very good, now that the graphics card is sorted and it has wonderful storage extensions. I have an SD card already functioning and intend to add an extra hard drive in due course. I really like the keyboard, which is nice to use and comfortable. The laptop seems quite sturdy and well-built and it is moderately light-weight for its size. So overall I am happy with it, despite the work I have had to pout in to get it up to spec. Of course, the problem with any new laptop is all the updating, the downloading and launching of various programmes. So sending it back after all that is a pain. Even more expensive laptops can have similar issues.\nSo for the money, I would recommend it. It will make a good travel laptop and one that I can use for screening the film I need to travel with for my work."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Where to start...\n1st the description \"mistakes\"\nI've linked their description at this time - Maybe they will try to cover this shady description when they read this review?\nThey Claim:-\n\"download and upload speeds are atleast 2x faster than traditional laptops\"\nThis is a completely wrong - the slowest part of the internet is not the home WiFi, but the internet service. Also, I think they are referring to it being compatible with 5ghz WiFi - that's the frequency of the transmission not the speed. Simply put, 2.4ghz penetrates walls better but 5ghz has greater range in an open area, so you get more choice in which WiFi to use. This has no bearing on your internet speed. 5ghz has been the standard since 2015, so if your laptop is newer than this, it will have the same speed WiFi.\nThey Claim\n\"Intel Cherrytrail Quadcore Processor is quick enough to launch your Windows programs with no lag whatsoever and play your favorite games in full speed\"\nThis processor is designed for tablets and notebooks from the start of 2016. It does not play any games in the UK top 10. Lag is a measurement of delay caused by a network, not loading programs - they seem to be using slang that gamers use to try and add some credibility to their system that it does not have.\nThey Claim\n32GB of on-board eMMC storage with the option to expand the memory up to 256GB with a Micro SD card (tf-card) or Insert a HDD (upto 1TB) and increase the internal storage immediately.\nThe 32GB of storage cannot be expanded. You can add a 2nd drive but you need to use the 32GB as a boot drive. More on this further into my review, as this is the thing that cripples the system.\nSo, my 3rd point as to why this is only worth 1 star is the fact that the primary HDD is so small, you cannot download updates for Windows 10 as there is not enough space for the downloads, and the version installed is 3 major updates old (about 18 months out of date) - it is from before the \"Spectre\" and \"Meltdown\" vulnerabilities were patched out (google this if you want to see how vulnerable this system is to cyber attacks). To try and resolve this I installed a newer version of Windows 10 using a group license from my work. This did not work as the camera, WiFi, Bluetooth, Graphics and Chipset are not supported by Windows 10 by default, as they need drivers from the manufacturer - and no WiFi = no internet to download them. This would only be inconvenient if the drivers were on their website like most manufacturers - there support section of the website has 0 posts! (image of their 0 post support added) After 5 messages to and fro with their \"support\" they would only give me the install files for the default out of date version of Windows 10 that comes with the system, giving the 2 options of not working correctly, or out of date and potentially vulnerable to attacks.\nI purchased this as although I knew the majority of the problems / \"alternative facts\" of the description, I had hoped I could add a 2.5\" hard drive and boot from that, where I would have plenty of space to do the updates. The system is locked down to only boot from the small eMMC Storage Drive (This drive, although a form of solid state is slower than many traditional hard drives)\nIf they linked the drivers on their web page, they would probably redeem a star or 2, but so far, this system is not worth the money unless you DON'T want internet and only want it for a little light office work, and you are competent enough to put the office program on your system with no CD / DVD drive or Internet.\nThe above issues are on top of the expected low quality of a budget laptop\nThe sound is very poor - I feel they have encased the speakers in the plastic moldings - put some speakers in a sealed Tupperware lunch box and you get the idea of how poor this sounds.\nThe plastic used feels thin and flimsy.\nThe poor structural design doesn't give me much hope for this lasting very long at all."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I got this product and have been using it for a week.

She needed something lightweight that she could carry with her college books that wouldn't take up too much room. This laptop seemed to fit the bill.\nThis laptop has a embedded hard drive, which is basically like an SD card but built into the motherboard, this is the only major issue with this laptop as it restricts you to just 32gb of storage, which after just 2 weeks was full up. All we added to the stock install was MS Office Professional. The hard drive capacity I think should be at least 100gb to cope with modern expectations. Thankfully there is the facility to add a second hard drive which can be upto 1tb. The bad thing is, you can't add the second drive and install windows on that drive as i was advised by the tech support at fusion5 which is disappointing.\nOther than the storage issue everything else is fine, the screen resolution is great, and the HD is fine. it won't win any awards, but it does what's expected at this price point. It comes with Windows 10 which is expected, and boots up nice and fast. As the hard disc is eMMc it's superquiet, and is pretty good at completing tasks as required. There is no DVD drive, so if you want to watch any films you need to store them on an external USB drive or memory stick.\nSo, in summary a really good laptop for the price, let down ONLY by insufficient storage capacity."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I bought this item for word processing and a little internet.

Charging is pretty rubbish. The charger cannot charge if the unit is in use. It can't even maintain a moderate charge. In an hour, the charge level dropped from 19% to 10% with the charger attached. Charging takes a long time. The initial charge time is seven hours I thought those days were gone).

Very lightweight and portable, but should take care not to damage as potentially flimsy to slight damage.\nOverall. Well worth the money for what it is. Not a powerful machine, but remain very pleased with purchase."}],"pictures":"\ndata:image/jpeg;base64,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
