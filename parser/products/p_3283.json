I am also bemused by the short length of this album being only 37 minutes with the previous albums being longer. I was a bit bemused by Reunion coming first before What Happened to Your Band unless the former is about something other than Busted reforming unless it is that way to give the latter the same track number as in the McBusted album. On the other hand it is nostalgic fitting in with a major theme of this album and it includes references to adult life, now that the band members are older, unlike the first two albums which focused mainly on adolescence."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Ive literally been a MASSIVE busted fan since they started. This Album is incredible. I seriously swear if you bought this you will be listening to it forever. Like till the year 3000. Thankyou again to the boys for making a life changing album. Love you guys so much!!!"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Bought for my mum as she doesn't download music and she was going to see Busted in concert so I wanted her to know the songs. Would have given 5 stars but the case arrived cracked. Not sure if it was posted like this or it happened during delivery. I was a bit disappointed since it was for my mum. But the CD was in perfect condition and she was grateful regardless."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is the Best Busted Album. Period.\nI, myself prefer their last effort, Night Driver\nBut as an album that \"defines\" the trío, this is the one, it runs light years around their first two albums, and then some. Congrats Busted, a contender for My Favourite Album Of The Year (and it's only been three months!)...\n...and congrats to AMAZON for an AMAZING Delivery Service!!!! Not even a week since I ordered my ítem from Argentina the it was AT MY DOOR (without none of the problems that Royal British Mail/Correo Argentino give you when purchasing an ítem via \"national mail\", hours waiting, time consuming trips to the Mail, unnecessary taxes... and did I mention time consuming??)  1000 out of 10 from me."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Some of the best music available today, new favourite album!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"More than meets the expectations.

It is PURE perfection. Particular highlights for me include Shipwrecked in Atlantis and It Happens, which I haven't been able to listen to through once without crying. And i'm a dude. I don't cry for nothing. This album is SPECIAL. Does it help that I can recreate the whole of Radio in the same vocal styles as Matt, James & Charlie? Yes. Does any other album make you want to dress like a Spaceman and stand on a treadmill whilst you listen to Race to Mars? Nope. Have I bought four copies because Busted are the best band of all time? Yes.\nAnd you should too. Buy one for your mum, your dad, your brother, sister, friends, work colleagues and anyone else you have ever met. If this album doesn't go number one I'll never buy an album again."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Following a drastic change in sound on their previous album Night Driver which was largely missing prominent guitars, Halfway There brings the guitars back and it brings them back BIG!\nHere's a track by track:\n1. Nineties\nA new sound that brings the guitars back with a BANG! The song starts with a Night Driver-esqe first verse and them BAM, the biggest guitar riff ever on a Busted record kicks in with Charlie Simpson belting out emotionally charged vocals. The lyrics are silly for sure, but the amount of conviction and emotion Matt, James and Charlie sing them with actually gives me the chills, the amount of emotion they've put into this song shows the passion for the band is bigger than ever before, one of the best Busted songs of all time!\n2. Reunion\nSTRAIGHT OUT OF 2002! If someone told me that this was an unreleased song from the debut album sessions back in 2002 then I'd believe them because it re-captures their debut album and b-sides sound PERFECTLY! The lyrics cleverly tie in a love song while also talking about Busted themselves AND IT'S GREAT, Busted are BACK back!\n3. What Happened To Your Band\nThe best Son Of Dork song. The best McBusted song. ONE OF the best Busted songs which really shows how great this band's output is when a song THIS GREAT is only ONE OF their best songs! I was only disappointed by the fact that instead of dropping the F bomb Matt instead says \"they mess with my mind and make me miserable\" so for that alone I prefer the McBusted version, but this is a great version. When I saw the tracklist I was a bit gutted that we were getting a song that has already been released, but end of the day this is one of the greatest songs James Bourne has ever written and you could put it on ANY album and it'd make the album even better,  Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Nevermind could benefit from this song so it's a very welcome addition to Halfway There and I get the chills everytime!\n4. Shipwrecked In Atlantis\nBack to back the 2 best songs on the album, What Happened To Your Band into Shipwrecked In Atlantis is one of the best one-two punches I've heard on ANY album ever! This song is pure pop-punk and has great riffs and melodies, it gets better by the listen and is easily and instantly one of my favourite Busted songs of all time! Like Nineties, despite the silly lyrics the conviction and emotion is there and you get the chills from just how great the vocal delivery is! Amazing song, my favourite on the album!\n5. Race To Mars\nI'm going to get negative here and admit that I'm not fussed.  It's a new sound and the chorus has its moments, but after the 5 star, A+ quality of the first 4 songs this one takes the songwriting quality down a bit, I'm just not feeling it lyrically, vocally or musically. I respect them for trying new things though and not keeping things strictly 2002, every artist needs to experiment!\n6. All My Friends\nSTRAIGHT OUT OF 2002! Like Reunion, this song is straight up old school Busted, sounds like an unreleased song from the debut album sessions! Lyrically it's great, the melody is great, it's Meet You There for 2019 and I love it! Lyrically it reminds me of The Kids Aren't Alright by The Offspring, telling stories about people they once knew and Busted have executed this topic brilliantly!\n7. MIA\nThe other song I'm not fussed on, it gives me vibes of an McFly - Above The Noise  album track. It just doesn't blow my mind like almost every other song on the album! The music and the melodies just don't do it for me (especially not the \"you're always MIA-a-a-a-a-a-a\") and the song doesn't give me any chills, the lyrics are the best part though. The bar was set too high and this doesn't reach it, my least favourite song on the album.\n7. Radio\nTHIS is doing a new sound right! It sounds like Stereophonics recorded a song and Kelly Jones was sick on the day so he called up Matt, James and Charlie to sing it and called Noel Gallagher in to play the guitar solo! BRILLIANT song, one of the best Busted have ever done and it's only my 4th favourite on the album which says a lot about the quality of the other songs! A great single choice and a breath of fresh air for the band!\n9. Nostalgia\nIt's pop-punk, but it's a new ground of pop-punk for Busted! The quiet verses into the big chorus, I'm not sure what it reminds me of, but it's a fresh Busted sound and I really like it! This is the song I have the least to say about, but the point is I like it, especially the verses, more fast pop-punk is always welcome with Busted!\n10. It Happens\nSTRAIGHT OUT OF 2002 again! Another that sounds like an unreleased song from the debut album sessions! It tells the story of Busted from their own perspectives and is an epic album closer, somewhat sad, somewhat uplifting, it's an emotional rollercoaster! A very triumphant song!\nOverall, this album feels like the missing link between Busted and A Present For Everyone. It's very self-aware of how the public think Busted should sound and borders on self parody sometimes, but the guitars are back, the songs are great and most importantly it's FUN which is what made Busted so huge in the first place!\nI rate this album 4/5 stars just because there's 2 songs I don't like, but the great songs are GREAT! Some of their best songs ever, but to me their best work is the 10 non-single album tracks on A Present For Everyone which are a very high bar and just great great songs without being self-aware of being Busted or not being Busted, whereas Halfway there is a very self-aware Busted sound!\nHalfway There is the 2nd best album Busted have made and as they've gone in the right direction by bringing the guitars back things will only get better! Almost like they planned it!"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"I find with Busted albums and any album\nwith a weird girl/woman obsessed fanbase they can ruin an actual opinion and just praise praise praise a poor album.\nFor me I am a 29 year old man, I was a teenager when Busted were popular and I did like them but always found them a bit naff to say you liked them.\nThey went away and that was it until MCBUSTED. That album\nwas excellent, really good combination of two groups revealing some top quality music writing.\nThen Charlie rejoined.\nNIGHTDRIVER is an excellent album. It was so different to old Busted songs which is what made it appealing.\nNow this album, to me, is a step backwards. it’s like they got too scared to try new things and went with what is easy. What you end up with is pop musics with no substance.\nThe only songs on the album that are worth listening to unless you are a 25 year old woman ( which is their mass audience now) are the following\n- RADIO 8/10\n- MIA 7/10\n- NINETIES 7/10\n- REUNION - 7/10\n- ALL MY FRIENDS - 5/10\nThe rest are pretty poor, you’re welcome to your opinion but they just lack anything.\n- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR BAND is not included as is a cover of a 4 year old MCBUSTED song and is a poor cover really and not as good.\nUltimately you are left with a poor effort to make an album. What they needed to do is build on NIGHT DRIVER and move forward.\nI see this is as album 3 and then Charlie left as he thought the music was rubbish.\n3/5 stars is fair. 50% of the tracks are not good.\nI can see them pushing out another album of this type of music before they quit again. Sadly they will never be popular and never reach number 1 in any chart. They lack mass appeal. They cater to people who have grown up now and need nostalgia mixed with step forwards"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"BUSTED ARE BACK - like, REALLY BACK! This new album 'Halfway There' progresses on the sound heard in 'A Present For Everyone' and BOY was this worth the wait! The whole album is a killer and a MUST-LISTEN!! This is their fourth album, but it feels like the TRUE third album that fans had been longing for so long! 'Night Driver' was needed for the trio's creativity and was a funky change-of-scenery for audiences, but Halfway There is a PROPER return to the Busted people love!\nSome of the songs from 'Halfway There' like 'Shipwrecked in Atlantis' (a sequel to 'Air Hostess') and 'What Happened To Your Band' have become some of my all-time favourite songs from the band! 'All My Friends' and 'It Happens are such heartfelt emotional stories of the Charlie, Matt and James's personal experiences with fame and friendship.  The rest of the tracks on this CD are Busted at their best!\nSpectacular work on this album, lads! Welcome back!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"To quote James Bourne when he said Busted were back BACK. He wasn't kidding.\nBusted are back.\nThis album is everything every original fan has hoped for. It has the same punk-pop like feel to it as some of the older tracks in the first two albums, but with a more grown up feel. A different road to their previous album Night Driver. But Half Way There is exceptional on all levels. Charlie, Matt and James have done extremely well with this, working with the amazing Gil Norton, Chris Bourne and Cobus. The lyrics, vocals, the backing tracks and just the production and way the whole record has been put together is absolutely fantastic. Couldn't have asked for better. It's a shame that I can only rate it 5/5 because it's worth so much more.\nPerfect album for any Busted fan old or young, new or original."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I was much impressed with Busted's long-awaited comeback album 'Night Driver' a few years ago, but with their latest effort they've returned to their trademark sound, this is the Busted of old, gone are the eighties-influenced synthpop and in return are the guitars. In fact, 'Reunion'  sounds so similar to the pop-punk  band who first hit the charts in 2002 that you might well mistake it for an unreleased track off their debut album.\nOf course, the band have matured musically as in well as age and as such this is an album which will appeal more to the adults than the teens. There are real standout tracks including the nostalgic opening song 'Nineties', 'Shipwrecked in Atlantis' which serves as another nod to the sound of their heyday, the acoustic rocker 'All My Friends' which has the makings of a real indie anthem along with the edgy 'Radio' which might surprise those still sceptical as to how far they've come and how credible these men now are. Not all of the other songs on the record are as memorable, a few just don't stand out to me, but I can safely say that there is more good than bad here.\nIf you're looking for another 'Night Driver' or an expansion of it, you won't find it with 'Half Way There', but if you want to relive the sound that made Busted so popular all those years ago, you can rest assured that you won't be left disappointed. The latter was polished and sophisticated, this one is raw and edgy."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I always thought Charlie was an incredible stand-out musician so have followed his music career since the Busted days. I was initially surprised to see Charlie going back to Busted (after being outspoken and suggesting he'd not enjoyed that kind of music). I thought Night Driver was a great return album, but this is also on par and is filled with catchy songs that I personally find very relatable. The three guys seem to be having fun, and it's a pleasure to see them doing well."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Short review, this album is unreal. The guys have really progressed as creative musicians and it shows, the time apart seems to have paid off! All the tracks are belters but I haven’t seen many mentions for “Nostalgia” as of yet so I felt it fitting to give it some hype, as it’s a brilliant song that will have you bouncing all over the place! “It happens” truly deserves all the praise it’s getting, a really beautiful track that ends the album perfectly. Now excuse me whilst I try and find some tickets to see these guys in March!!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Busted are back to their tuneful pop/punk/rock best. Standouts for me: What Happened To Your Band (would be worth it for this masterpiece alone), Nostalgia, Shipwrecked in Atlantis, Nineties, Reunion, Radio, and the acoustic-led All My Friends. So, basically the whole album - and all 10 tracks are strong in their own right. More mature, reflective lyrics than in the past but not quite grown-up, such as the lighthearted Shipwrecked... (a follow up to Air Hostess). Produced by the ever-reliable Gil Norton, with outstanding drumming from YouTube legend Cobus. Buy it and help give these likeable guys the success they deserve, again."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"As delighted as I was to have Busted back releasing music again with Night Driver, this album just fills me with delight to have the boys back doing what made me love them.  Guitars and fun reflections on every day life is where they excel.  A more chilled out version of their younger selves will bring a smile to your face and have you singing along before you know it."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"i've loved busted since the early 2000's - they fill me full of nostalgia. I listened to them on the way home from my first date with my now husband 15 years ago.  This album is just the continuation of the old busted sound.  That said, i absolutely loved night driver!  Thanks for giving me more music to make more amazing memories with!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Busted are BACK. Superb return to form. Everything I could want and more from a Busted album in 2019. If you like bands such as blink-182, Green day, New f Found Glory etc you will love this.\nIf you weren't a fan of the 80s pop vibe of the previous album but loved their old stuff you will love this.
