Macbook pro.

It feels very nice in the hand, almost as nice as my apple magic mouse.  I bought this for my newly acquired notebook as I'm not keen on track pads.  The mouse connected immediately with the included dongle which fits neatly inside the mouse when not needed.  It's powered by 2 x AAA batteries.  I've had much more expensive mice in the past and this mouse is up there with the most expensive ones in quality and performance.  I would definitely recommend this mouse."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Bought this after reading reviews and I can say I wasn't disappointed.\nThe mouse is far superior from the ones years ago with a ball underneath.\nThis is sleek with a soft feel, the added extra of not hearing that clicking all the time is fantastic.\nAn added function is being able to turn it off when not in use so you don't rub the batteries out\nNo issues with connecting to the laptop, once the USB was inserted it connected almost instantly.\nI have this to use with my laptop and fits nicely in the laptop bag."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Very happy with this - it looks like a mouse that you might have paid £35+ for .. I had an older but similar mouse which was plasticky and a bit rough.. this one looks slick.. clicks and roller feel dampened and good quality - scrolling is less jerky .. I'm glad I bought it.. I'm an Apple user who's also been forced to use a PC through work .. so anything I can use with the PC that makes it feel less like a PC is great with me.. and this mouse helps! ... I'd buy it without hesitation.... 7 months in.. still on the original batteries and working well. I use it with both the PC & Mac book, no problems.

The odd thing is it's using 2 AAA batteries.\nIt's quite slim, so.. not for people who need a fatter mouse, obviously.\nNow if this thing passes the test of time I will keep the 5 stars rating. If not.. Boing!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Works out the box on Linux Mint 19 with no configuring or pairing necessary, just plug in and it works.  Really nice build quality with smooth matt black surface.  Buttons do click, just very quietly, so you do get tactile feedback.  Wheel feels nice with just the right amount of resistance between lines of scroll.  Button underneath scroll wheel gives three levels of sensitivity/dots per inch, without having to go into any settings on PC.  Glides great on fabric mouse mat or wooden desk and seems equally at home on both in terms of responsiveness.  No branding or writing on it, which I like, It's just a stylish black wireless mouse that looks good and works well.  Good value for money, I've seen similar for three times as much.  Recommended."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This mouse is just brilliant. I bought 2, both working in close proximity between laptop and PC with no interference between them. If not used for while it switches off to conserve battery life. A little push button on top brings the mouse back to life. A little usb dongle connects the mouse to the computer. Simple. No software installation needed."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"In terms of use this mouse was exactly what I wanted. Slim, quiet and functional. Even the 3 level DPI button worked well and I could clearly see the difference between the different settings and found it useful.\nHowever, as a number of other reviewers reported mine also ceased to work within a relatively short time. As I would expect at least a couple of years use from such a product I left a one star review  and was immediately contacted by the seller who very politely offered to send a replacement, which they quickly did.

This little gem not only quashes any worries of the past, but is probably the best mouse I've used (so far!)\nSo, I got looking for a replacement mouse, as a change to my setup meant that running cables (and hiding cables) just wasn't a practical option. I also like to have plenty freedom of movement, without any worries of cables getting caught / snagged; so the obvious answer was to look at a proper wireless / cordless option.\nNow, before I took the plunge on a 'all the bells and whistles' option (knowing already that you can spend some serious monies on configuration 'gaming' devices), I just did a skim through of the better reviews. Yes, I then was hit with a wave of doubt (skepticism?) when I saw the price (how could something that inexpensive live up to the job?) Well, it's arrived, I've set it up (with no fuss at all) and I really am thinking that I wish I'd move to this mouse a long time ago.\nSetup is very simple. You just plug in the Bluetooth dongle to your machine (it's neatly tucked inside the battery compartment of the mouse, should you use this for travel). You pop a pair of 'AA' batteries into the mouse (take note that they both orientate the same way, with matching terminals at the same end). You flick the switch (on/off), it'll pair and, well, there was nothing else I needed to do...\nMouse movement is calibrated from my existing setup, so I had nothing to change. The button actions and scroll wheel are also spot on.\nIt's a lighter movement, a nicer (lower profile) shape, comfortable and well, a joy to use. Yes, I'm rather pleased with it.\nThe 'satin' finish does pick up finger-prints, but so far it's dead easy to wipe / clean (you'll not find any recommendations about eating lunch at a computer in the instructions).\nGreat value, well made and I'll happily get another."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Inexpensive, small, but not so small as to make it awkward to hold, responsive and comfortable to use with my laptop.
