Responsive, lots of programmable buttons, allows me to type very quickly. Last one lasted years so have no doubt this one will do the same. Very good price for a solidly built keyboard. Not quiet, but I didn't want a quiet keyboard as I like the auditory feedback when I'm typing."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I love this keyboard! The touch is satisfying and ergonomic, making it the perfect companion for long hours spent writing essays and reports. The additional function keys (relating to sound and calculator) are a nice touch. The size of the keyboard is perfect for me and the positioning of keys combined with their responsiveness is great, particularly as I type more than 100WPM and so can be quickly frustrated by a bad keyboard! A great purchase!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This keyboard was a quick purchase, due to the fact that my earlier one started malfunctioning.\nI have now been using it for a few months.\nIt has a standard UK layout, hotkeys and function keys alongside arrow keys and a numpad (all in standard positions).\nAs it's a USB keyboard, you simply need to plug it in (no batteries, just one wire you plug into the USB port on your computer). It was very fast to get set up. Your computer should quickly recognise that a new device has been plugged in and you should be able to use it right away. This all worked perfectly, and I was able to get going quickly.\nThe keys are not clunky and noisy like some keyboards, but instead feel much more distinguished and soft. There is still some noise though, so if you like a whisper-quiet keyboard, this may not be for you.\nI have large hands and my partner has small hands; we are both happily able to use this keyboard without any problems. There is ample gap in between each key to avoid hitting multiple keys when typing at speed, and the spacing is very very similar to the Microsoft keyboard this was bought to replace - so re-learning the key positions was not necessary.\nPRO:\nThe hotkeys work with my Windows 10 machine.\nNice, slightly curved, profile allows for a small rake to the keys which helps to pick them out.\nSeems very sturdy and advertises spill-resistance - which I believe is true.\nRear stands to adjust the angle of the keyboard up to around 4.5cm at the back.\nSoft keys with not too much noise.\nUSB connection - quick to get set up.\nCON:\nCould provide more options for keyboard rake on adjustable stands (forward tilt).\nQuite chunky (not slimline)\nAn exceptionally good keyboard for the price."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This keyboard arrived sooner than was estimated, which is great. It looks a lot more modern than the product photos show. The Windows key is a modern Win8/10 symbol and isn't embossed - all keys are a dark grey ink on off-white (at least on the white keyboard option). The separate calculator key is fantastic. As are the media keys - the only thing missing from the media keys would be forward/back buttons, but it suffices without them. It isn't whisper quiet, but has a lot less noise than some others. All keys are pretty much where they should be, with separate blocks for INS/HOME/PGUP etc, and arrow keys so they're not all squished together like some laptop keyboards. Overall dimensions are approx 45cm wide, 16cm deep. all-round great buy."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"UPDATE: a year later and this is still working perfectly. 10/10 would buy 100 more times.\nI'm an office administrator and at work I need a keyboard so I can comfortably type while still being more than arm's length from my laptop. This was a perfect answer! Long cable, quiet keys that don't click suitable for office work, soft press keys that are very easy on the fingers/wristsand not so small they are difficult to press or so big they are awkwardly spaced etc. It has kept very well over the last five months, being heavily used nine hours a day five days a week, none of the letters have rubbed off and all keys are still accounted for. I bought a previous cheap keyboard from eBay but it had keys in places other than where they were labelled, some just didn't work, they were loose, loud and took several pressed sometimes to make work right from brand new. This is completely the other end of the spectrum, everything works, smartly packaged instead of just tape and bubble wrap, high quality and all keys are properly and accurately mapped out. Very good quality considering it is at the very low end of the budget for keyboards.\nPostage was very prompt and for the money it was a great price. May not be suitable for gaming if you want programmable keys as there are none, it's very easy to use at work and take wherever you like as it's USB connection. Black and white design makes it look very smart on my desk and it's been so hard wearing that if it broke tomorrow I'd just buy another one. It may not be what you want for a home computer if you're looking for flashing lights, custom keys and clacking mechanical keys but it's been a great addition to my desk.\nMet every part of my expectations."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great, cheap, multi-purpose keyboard. The keys are firm, which I like, but they also don't make too much noise. It's well-built and I haven't had any problems at all with it.\nThe keyboard is very minimalist and doesn't have many additional buttons aside from the standard querty keyboard. However, it does have some extra buttons at the top to control your speakers which I use often."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I purchased this keyboard in 2014, and 4 years later, it is still working flawlessly.\nI wasn't looking for anything other than a basic keyboard that would last me a good few years, and thought that a Microsoft product would do just that. I have no need for wireless connectivity or a special gaming keyboard, so this has been absolutely ideal.\nYou basically get what you would expect; a plug and play USB connected keyboard with the very basic of keys that should last you a number of years. There are a few special keys in the form of a play, pause and volume button, which is a bonus, but apart from that, there is no unnecessary bells and whistles. The keys feel responsive, cushioned and comfortable, which creates less noise when typing than keyboards I've used in the past. All in all a great and essential buy.\nIf for what ever reason I did need another new keyboard in the future, I would go for this one again in a heartbeat. Considering the price and durability it has been a great purchase. 5 Stars.\n*Please let me know if you found this review helpful. Thanks*"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I have had this keyboard for more then 3years and it still works as good as they day I got it. I can't actually believe it has lasted me this long as it was so cheap compared to some others.\nThe keys are nice and clicks and have alot of travel, the stands on the back that props up the keyboard slightly are durable and still work fine after all this time. None of the keys have worn and still look like new with very occasional cleaning. The lights for caps lock and so on are easy to see and bright. What more could you want, I use it for gaming also and have had no problems with it for that either.\nWould recommend"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought this as an interim keyboard when my Corsair gaming keyboard needed to be sent back for RMA. I also use the computer for work so needed a cheapo keyboard to tied me over. At the same time I didn't want to get a really cheap keyboard that was going to be horrible to use for the duration. (Clearly this is a much, much cheaper membrane keyboard than my mechanical keyboard so I will not be making a like-for-like comparison).\nI've used Microsoft keyboards many times before and they are normally fairly decent build quality and nice to type on. For me, this keyboard was no exception in that department and felt well made, nice to type on and surprisingly quiet whilst doing so (completely silent compared to my mechanical keyboard!).\nInstallation was a breeze with a USB port for simple plug and play and Windows 10 had no trouble detecting the keyboard. It also has a number of useful media and shortcut keys along the top\nFor the money I don't think you can go wrong with this keyboard, I cannot fault it in any way."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I got this on Amazon for £9.99. For the money, its an absolute steal. The build quality is significantly better than my old  Logitech (MK270 at £24.99) in a few ways: first, everything is built solidly meaning the keys don't rattle at all. On my Logitech if I shook the keyboard, you'd hear the keys jiggle around. This Microsoft 600 Keyboard doesn't do that. Second, the overall design seems to have not much cost cutting, the bottom of the device is solid plastic unlike the Logitech which had flimsy plastic and tons of cutout holes. And finally, the Microsoft keyboard has large rubber feet molded into the bottom of the keyboard (not just glued-on rubber pads that eventually come off).\nThe only flaw in the keyboard so far is the raisers don't have rubber grips, so while the keyboard grips decently to the desk, the raisers are a bit slidey.\nThis is not a mechanical keyboard, it is just a membrane one - so don't expect the best typing experience ever known, but if you are used to membrane keyboards like I am, then this is just more of the same. Function keys are small, so that may take some getting used to. The media controls are a nice addition too. And the keyboard also has SCRL/CAPS/NUM lock LED indicators. The top right of the keyboard has a nice shiny Microsoft logo (I think painted/printed on - maybe it will wear down over time).\nI got the \"White\" variant, and while the pictures show a more greyish tone; they are deceiving. The keyboard really is white. While I was hoping for it to be greyish, I'm actually happy with the white. Its really nice and clean looking and blends nicely into my white desk. The wire and USB plug are also white. The keyboard is just plug in and go. Windows instantly recognizes it and it's working within a couple of seconds.\nOverall, this is a very affordable keyboard and is surprisingly high quality. I imagine this keyboard will be durable and hopefully it will last many many years. [I'll update this review if it breaks.]"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I’ve lost count how many keyboards I have used over the years and in time this will be added to that list.\nThe reason for so many keyboards is that I play a lot of games and the keyboard plays a big role in this ( online games ) as I am quite messy with drinks and I tend to spill them a lot.\nAll keyboards can quite easily be cleaned and are robust enough to take whatever I put them through and this is no different.\nBecause of the way I have the layout of my gaming desk it suits me to have a wired device, plus it stops me from lobbing it whenever I have game losers rage.\nIf you need a keyboard at a fair price, this is worth a try."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"Pros: nice beige colour, lovely smooth and quiet keys, letters and symbols are printed on and not on tacky plastic transfers.\nCons: legs are a bit flimsy (they are nice and wide but not thick enough, if you dropped it on the floor they would most likely break), over the top heath warning sticker making you feel you will die using it lol.\nUPDATE: After just a two days of using this keyboard, I noticed that the space-bar started squeaking badly! I also noticed that when I typed words, there were delays before the letters appeared on the screen. I do regret buying this now, and after much to-ing and fro-ing I have decided to send it back to Amazon, which I did not really want to do, as this is the second keyboard I have bought, but its just not up to scratch.\nI decided the best thing to do was to get an expensive keyboard, and so I have ordered a Cherry MX Board 3.0 (which I did not get from Amazon, mainly because it was a bit more expensive and I found in general that the cherry keyboards on Amazon were poorly pictured and titled, meaning I was not sure I would get a UK layout, so ordered it from a specialist PC website instead where it was clear what layout I was getting).\nMy view is if you want a cheap keyboard for a teenager or child this is a good option, but if you want a decent keyboard for touch typing you are really going to have to spend at least £50-£60."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Only had this a few days but it seems OK so far. Acceptable quality for the price.\nMy only (but quite serious) negative would be that because the keys are flat to the keyboard surface, touch typing is difficult as it's very easy to hit 2 keys at once, they don't feel separated enough. You end up having to hold your fingers quite high over the keys and hit them very precisely. I wouldn't buy this if you have large fingers.\nI prefer my old Dell keyboard, where the keys stuck up further from the keyboard but unfortunately it gave up after many years of faithful service."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I've had this keyboard for a couple of months and have found it really comfortable to type on. Yesterday, I spilled a full glass of water all over it. I have a bad habit of doing that (you'd think I'd have learned to keep any drinks well away from the keyboard by now!) and I must have ruined at least three keyboards over the years this way. I (optimistically) put it upside down and left it to dry over night but really wasn't expecting it to work again. I'm typing on it now - it's just as responsive as ever and doesn't seem to have suffered any damage at all. Very impressed!"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I bought this as a replacement for my old and failing Microsoft 'Digital Media Keyboard 1.0A' which was failing to type every so often. I was surprised how cheap the replacement 600 was but my fears about cheap quality were unfounded as it is a first class keyboard and a very tidy and efficient layout. The keys lack the 'feel' or subtle resistance of my older keyboard which is a slight disappointment and made it feel a bit cheap to the touch initially but I quickly got used to it. The keys are reasonably quiet with not clatter. The more efficient layout means the keyboard takes up less space than my old one, having done away with programmable keys and shortcut keys and other odd controls I never used anyway. At least the calculator key is kept, which is the only extra I wanted, and some volume buttons. If I am nit picking the slope of the keyboard is too shallow (with tiny legs up) but that may also be because it was a bit steeper on the old keyboard. In any case, miles better than any laptop keyboard.\nOverall a good keyboard and exceptional value for money, and apparently spills resistant . . . but I am not checking that out."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"Very nicely made keyboard that feels durable but the keys are quite flush with the base with not much travel and some keys such as Esc and F keys are very small and you can mis-hit them quite easily especially if you use them a lot as I do in my job which makes for slower typing.  It's a very nice keyboard but I prefer larger keys that stand more proud of the base.  On the plus side there is a dedicated calculator button which brings up the onscreen calculator."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Plug it in. Start up.The BIOS recognises it immediately and away to go.\nThe keyboard works with windows - it is Microsoft after all.\nThe keyboard looks like quality and has a nice feel to the keys.\nThe key pad and caps lock have very small tell-tale diodes which a good thing.\nOverall happy especially as it's very reasonably priced."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is just what I needed and it has all the basic keys that you would need for everyday use.  It also has caps lock indicator which I missed on my previous keyboard and a calculator key which is a bonus.  The keys are soft enough and not too noisy.  I am very pleased with it and like other buyers, I have also bought 2 of these keyboards for such good value.  Only time will tell as to how long they will last."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"There's probably only so much you can say about a keyboard but this really is a delight to use. I've got a boring 9-5 job and it involves sitting at a desk all day, typing emails, completing spreadsheets, etc. so anything that makes my day more enjoyable is a bonus.\nThis keyboard helps. Keys are nice and quiet and very smooth. Standard UK layout. The multimedia buttons are always helpful.\nI just love this thing. Really. Went for the white too and it has a nice retro look about it.\nEDIT: Spoke too soon. It's going back. There's an unbearable squeak from the spacebar now. Can't be dealing with that."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Gotta say this is probably my favourite gaming and typing keyboard ever - maybe even more so than mechanical keyboards (and I've tried lots)!\nFirst off I just want to say that I've been using mechanical keyboards a couple of years back - I own a Cherry MX Brown switch keyboard and used to have a Cherry MX Red one. I really like my mechanical keyboards, but sometimes I feel like the force you need to press down the keys and the noise made does take away from the experience.\nI have been trying out rubber dome switches in recent times - I have tried dozens of them. My preference is towards low profile keys that require very little force to press down, making really fast typing and gaming possible, but it also needs to give a satisfying force on each press down and be comfortable to use for extended periods of times.\nI first encountered this keyboard when I was working full-time as an office assistant, and I had one of these keyboards to use at my desk. I quickly fell in love with this keyboard and how easy it was to type on, as well as the extreme quietness of it.\nI went and got one for myself for use as a gaming keyboard and I really like almost everything about this keyboard. The keypresses are very quiet if you type with normal force, even if you type furiously it is still much quieter than mechanical keyboards.\nI can type really quickly on this keyboard, the keys go down very solidly and you know that you won't miss a key because the actuation point is exactly when the key starts to move down.\nErgonomically, I really like the slight curve of the keys, it is subtle but you can really notice a difference to how you rest your hand on it. Makes long gaming/working sessions comfortable.\nMy only slight gripe with it is the function keys. The smaller size of the F-keys along the top makes sure you won't press them by accident, and they are pretty satisfying to press, however there are a couple of games that use these keys (namely starcraft 2) and it does make it ever so slightly harder to press them. However it is still manageable as they are positioned well, you just need to get used to them having a different feel.\nBest thing of all is that this is one of the cheapest keyboards you can get - so even if the buttons wear down slightly after months of use, you can buy 10 or more of these for the price of a mechanical keyboard, so that's almost not an issue."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I purchased the Microsoft Wired Keyboard 600 in white as I was a bit fed up of having all black peripherals for my PC. It is such a pleasure to type on, the keys are quiet but not too quiet and have a nice feel to them.

It has reduced my typing errors, increased my speed and is quite quiet, certainly quiet enough not to disturb anyone but enough to know that you have pressed a key.

Fine if you are a touch typist and never look at the keys, but a nightmare for the average user.  Not the quality I expect from a Microsoft own brand product.  Very disappointed. Perhaps they would like it back and replace it for me."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"For the low price of the keyboard, this is actually really good. For the past few years, I'd been using a wireless keyboard but every so often it would lose its signal and stop working. I wanted a wired keyboard and this one fits the bill. They keys are soft touch and are on a slant so it's a lot nicer to type on. I still suggest having a separate wrist rest to help you though. Works perfectly on Windows 10. Plugged it in and it was working straight away."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"For just over £10 I wasn't expecting to much, but thought it would be better than a £5 one I bought in a high street retailer (that lasted less than a week before the keys started to fail).\nAs I bought this to replace an older very sturdy built ps/2 keyboard, I wasn't sure how the MS 600 would compare, but so far after a few weeks of use I am still impressed.  It is very smooth, quiet and easy to use.  There are a few multimedia keys which work fine, but I don't use them much.  I'm running Win7 64bit and it was a simple plug in and allow auto driver install to run the first time.  I could still use my ps/2 keyboard if I wanted to keep it connected, but once I had disconnected the old keyboard it required a reboot to allow it to be used in the future, just a Windows driver thing, not an problem.\nThe only slight issue is a small but important size difference, this keyboard is very slightly smaller than my old one, so as I touch type most of the time I have had to just slightly adjust to the angle on a couple of keys, but no major problems.  The feel of the keys is much lighter and I can type with much less pressure and as a result appear to be a little faster than before,  This keyboard is also at least 50% quieter than my old keyboard that had a distinct click on each keystroke as well as more pressure required on each key - there is a click with this keyboard, and there is a positive feel to the contact with the keys, it is just quieter.\nIn summary, a very good general use keyboard, with a nice feel.  Good value for the price and I will add more to this review when I have used it for several months."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I hammer my keyboards, replacing them annually so don't see the point of spending a lot. I was delighted to discover the cheap 600 is well built, doesn't move around the desk in use and is comfortable for periods of prolonged use.\nIt's slightly longer that its predecessor, the 500, but is significantly quieter. The keys are not squeaky like some cheap makes either. Key travel is short and my typing speed is surprisingly good given the price point so I can live with the slight rattle of the space bar.\nIt's a simple, solid workhorse."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I've had a Dell Inspiron for about 6 years and finally decided to get a new keyboard after the \"O\" half rubbed out and I started thinking it was an \"i\"\nDid a bit of research and was happy to spend up to about £40 if the quality made it worthwhile. I looked at the ergonomic ones, the backlit ones, and the wireless ones. All costing £30+ and none of them getting brilliant reviews.\nEventually I saw this at £10. A bargain by price for sure, but would be it easy to use, would it be pretty quiet? The answer is yes to both. The previous Dell KB was clanky when you typed and I needed a mat under it. This one is sleek and quiet, has a decent tilt and looks great.\nWon't gush any more for this (a keyboard!), but for a tenner it's damn good value and great to use."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Compared to the alternatives in this price range I think it's safe to assume this is the best you can get. A very simple layout but has some of the more essential hotkeys, seems sturdy and well built and most importantly comfortable to use. I was also very pleasantly surprised by how quiet the keys where. No problems with setting up or with the connections as well.\nThe only negative I've noticed so far is the legs - they do seem to be the weakest component of the keyboard and while they shouldn't break off easily, I wouldn't put too much stress on them as the plastic does look to be somewhat thin."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"I am not a heavy fingered typist and don't stab at the keyboard, but after just two months use, the letters are fading on some of the keys.
