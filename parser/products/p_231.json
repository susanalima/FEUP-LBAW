Lovely machine in excellent condition.  Well pleased with it.  Easy to set up with everything on it as described.  Had what I thought was a problem and emailed the seller who emailed a mobile number back for contact out of hours.  The issue was cleared up over the phone in a friendly and 'no worries' conversation.  I could never afford this bit of kit new and so a lovely refurbed laptop was just the thing.  Great machine for the money and accessible seller, which is better than buying new from corporate entities with no interest in your problems!  Thanks Danny from Thedesignerlaptopshop,  Would buy from you again, no worries."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Eflex seller is recommended to deal with. Had a minor issue in relation to the software but eflex has resolved it. I would highly recommend this seller if you are about to buy this laptop. In relation to the laptop, its one of the best highly configured laptop at this price range. You will get super fast (specially at turbo) core i5 quad core CPU, 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD. Win 10 boot time is approx. 10 seconds. Make sure to register your OS as soon as you boot it for the very first time."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"I had the laptop all set up and was impressed until the left touchpad button suddenly stopped working. tried everything seller suggested ,win updates, win10 reinstall, driver updates, to no avail. Rendered laptop unusable. Common hardware problem with this laptop apparently, guess thats why it was a refurb. returned for refund."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"After having problems with another online refurbished laptop seller, I was wary. However, my misgivings were unfounded. This item arrived in excellent condition with straightforward instructions. So far so good. The sound quality is not as good a my previous laptop, however, I don't use it for gaming so  not a problem. It's lightweight yet packs a punch. Very fast. I use it for work and usually have 2 to 3 spreadsheets  plus 4 to 5 cloud based applications that I'm working on. In addition, I usually have an on demand TV programme running aswell! Would highly recommend this company."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Arrived as advertised. Used for Microsoft office, Internet and some Paintshop, very fast. Keys are a delight to type on mousepad is very smooth and responsive. Highly satisfied with this purchase."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great value quality laptop, came as described in a new clean condition.\nI bought this EliteBook 840 as my personal business laptop, I'm running 2 additional 23\" lcd screens off a Dell USB docking stations.\nI'm using multiple Visio and Powerpoint sessions along with other Office apps and finding it excellent."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"This is only one star review I have ever left on Amazon.\nThe product was shipped with a malfunctioning SSD which meant that it would not boot. I didn’t know this at the time and had initially thought my daughter had interrupted the initial boot process when the laptop was first turned on. I tried unsuccessfully to install Windows 10 myself. The vendor emailed a set of generic instruction on how to do this. However, whilst I could just about manage to make the laptop boot off a USB stick. I certainly could not do it off the hard drive. The vendors advice was that I maybe install it on the hard drive!!! Really....don’t you think I’ve tried? As I customer I may have expected to be given a name or a number to contact. I was given neither.\nSo I took my unbootable laptop to a professional repair centre. It’s important to note that this invalidated my warranty. But they were at least able to diagnose what was ailing the laptop. What was interesting was what they found. The SSD had failed...which explained why I was unable to install Windows 10. All the paperwork that tells how well it has been tested and reconditioned; well I’m not particularly convinced it’s in anyway genuine..one more time, the SSD failed before it was used for the first time. Even better was hearing that there were several screws missing. Why this should be I’m not sure! And not that I’d have found out about this without expert help.\nI did contact the vendor with what had happened and their concern was to confirm that I had indeed invalidated the warranty and would not be eligible for any form of refund\nTheir concern was not that they had shipped an sub standard product.\nTheir concern was not that their internal QC had failed.\nTheir concern was that I had invalidated the warranty and therefore they did not have to do anything.\nI still have the faulty SSD if they want it back....I’m suspecting not."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"The shipping was faster than I thought it'd be and it was packed really well too. The computer has been working really well so far. Set up was easy and it has been able to run adobe photoshop so far. I've only had it about a few weeks but its been running well and I like it. It's pretty light weight and can fit in my small backpack."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Waited a while to give feedback and am able to report  it is a very good piece of equipment. I am very pleased with it. Setting it up was fairly easy although I did have a bit of help setting up my email address! It looks as new to me so I am well satisfied."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Absolutely delighted with this laptop far exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend it, compact and reasonably lightweight design and fast what's not to like? Very pleased with my purchase!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Buying a recon computer is always a worry when not seeing the product. this, however, performs better than expected with a solid state memory. It is being used for a 1 person business and is ideal for this purpose. All iI would say is, be aware that a 14.1 inch screen may not be to your liking"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I decided to purchase a refurbished laptop to replace my 4-5-month-old laptop which is incredibly slow when opening applications such as Microsoft Word.\nI cant really say how good this laptop wears as I've only had it a few days but so far I am impressed. It gets the job done without lagging which is exactly what I needed and wanted.\nShould this laptop ever need to be replaced, I would consider buying another refurb.\nI wish, I had purchased this laptop from the beginning as it would've saved me from paying £220 for now something that will just lay around doing nothing."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"A1 condition, looked as good as new.\nSo far it's performed flawlessly. Boots up in seconds and the screen quality is excellent.\nSeems a bargain"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Laptop arrived in good time. Condition is very good, minimal cosmetic problems.  Performance is impressive so far and accompanying booklet very useful. Very well packed and presented.  All in all a good buy and value."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Initial impression is the product is very good. Having said that to load sql software I needed to reset factory settings. The office was not open over the weekend to help. Small frustrations with the finger sensor that seems to never recognise my prints. Other than that I think value for the money."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"It starts and oporates very fast, faster than my old 500GB HDD - 8GB Ram - i5 Core computer. No problems with setting it up. Nice to use. It even smelled kind of new out of the box.\nTwo issues:\n1) I noticed that the left hinge for opening and closing the screen was a little bit loose, however not loose enough to lose sleep over. It did not effect the usability or portability of the computer. Im just a little more gentle with it than I would have been otherwise.\n2) If you plan on typing and resting your palms to the left and right of the track pad, expect the glittery paint-coating to wear some what. However, this also happened to my last computer and is not a reason to stop yourself from buying.\nIf the first issue was not there I would have probably given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"I was surprised upon receiving the laptop that the battery lasted only two hours tops. Then on the second second day of receiving it, it stopped charging completely. The pop-ups on the screen are very blurry and the touch pad isn't very responsive when it comes on to tapping to select things. If it wasn't for these I'd be quite happy with my purchase. Its lightweight, attractive and easily portable. 'll be contacting the seller to see what they can do about the issues."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"It doesn't have all the features you expect from a better spec'ed laptop, but for it's price it is great value.  Fast loading of apps and software.  Its small and light, so perfect if you do carry it around with you all day.  Best small laptop I've owned."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Nearly unmarked, a great machine for the casual user.  Impressively fast and lightweight.  Needed the Netboot feature disabled to stop annoying attempt to 'netboot'.  But easily done after quick telephone call.  I am seriously impressed, I wonder if any of them have 1TB ssd's?"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Refurbished but excellent condition, love the backlit keyboard"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"It goes a bit slow after awhile of using it.

Whats not to like."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"With little difficulties at the start (functional keys where not working => needed a driver) over all I am very happy now. The laptop has hardly any signs of usage and with 2,5h battery life while working, I guess I have to be happy, since it is 2.nd hand.\nOverall still a good deal."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"So far... the unit came quickly, well protected. Turned on instantly. Set up was easy. Start up close is rapid. 10 Pro is very comprehensive. 8GB memory makes everything fast. The battery comes fully charged and is very long lasting.

I can't find any fault with the product."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Terrific laptop, worth twice the price"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I am very happy so far with this laptop.

Used literally for entertainment, it is good for that purpose."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I've had this laptop for a few weeks now and it has proved to be excellent value for money. I was nervous about buying a refurbished one but it is as good as new and I use it for several hours per day in my new business."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"The laptop itself deserves 3 to 4 Starts but refurbished I was expecting the battery to hold charge for roughly about half that of a new on while with this one it miserably dies only after 10 minutes at best meaning it can only be used while
