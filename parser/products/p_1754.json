I reccomend the msi amd r370 2gb or 4gb. This will set you back $120. For many games you need a better cpu. I reccomend the amd fx6300. This will cost an extra $95.\nWithout these extra components you wouldnt be able to play any \"BIG\" games such as GTA 5 or Star wars Battlefront etc. You cant expect much from a $400 gaming pc with a large monitor, keyboard, mouse and a nice headset. Without the extra components GTA 5 will be below the minimum requirements and even if you play it it would be abou 1-4 fps. Games like CS:GO would give you 30-40 fps but it could go down to 10-15 on flash bangs. If you are a gamer but you dont have much money and you want to play bigger games like GTA 5 it is better off building your own as it is cheaper. For gamers who have money this is a choice for you.
