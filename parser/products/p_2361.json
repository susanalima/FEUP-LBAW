I went through a few and finally decided to go to PC World and test a few out.\nThis was waaay above my price range but I loved how it felt. The clicky feel is so luxurious (in my opinion) and I couldn't find anything that felt similar.\nPC World had terrible returns policies - if you buy it in store you can't return it unless it's faulty, but they also wouldn't let us take the keyboard out of the box to test it... so we didn't buy from them! Fortunately, Amazon had better returns policies, but I fell in love and haven't wanted to send it back.\nI did get insurance through Amazon on it though. Around £25 for 3 years I believe, which I think is worth it for such an expensive keyboard.\nThe wrist support is brilliant and easy to remove (just pulls away, it's magnetic), if it's too big or you want to remove it for whatever reason.\nIT IS NOT QUIET!!! This doesn't bother me, in fact I quite like it, but my partner hates it as his mic picks it up when he's streaming... oops."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I've got to say, I was a little cautious when picking this as my next keyboard:\n1, Because I've read negative reviews surrounding Razer and their build quality\n2, Because of their switches\nI had a 2014 Blackwidow tournament edition before receiving my new keyboard and still works great to this day. However, I started to feel left out with all the RGB lights and fancy switches around, so I took the plunge.\nI've got to say, in my opinion, my concerns have not become a reality:\n- First off, the Orange switches are LOVELY to type and game on, I would definitely recommend them. They have that satisfying and reassuring feel to them. After testing the keyboard with a couple of matches on killing floor 2 , the keyboard performs a dream! The switches feel accurate and comfortable to game on. I cannot give an opinion compared with Cherry switches, but they do feel really nice to use.\nSecondly, the wrist rest is amazing and is a key reason I went for this keyboard instead of the Corsair range. Previously, I had to suffer from achy wrists while playing games. When choosing my next keyboard, I wanted to try and reduce that from occurring. I can say, the wrist rest is soft but firm at the same time, providing the perfect wrist support for me. After playing a few games, I am not going to lie, I was surprised to notice my wrists were not aching like they usually had.\nFinally, I really like the sleek and stealth design of Razer keyboards, though an aluminum body would be nice compared with the likes of Corsairs range, the plastic does feel strong and sturdy on the Chroma V2. Additionally, the RGB backlit keys look amazing, I haven't messed around with the Synapse software that much, but they're really cool (From someone who has never owned a keyboard with RGB backlit keys) and the USB and audio pass-through are a nice touch, although I do not think they should be on the right of the keyboard, on the back would be better.\nWould I recommend it? Yes. If you're looking for a sleek, stealthy keyboard but also something that is equipped with a switch that is solid for gaming and typing, but offers support and comfort while doing so, then go for it!\n---------------------\nBad points:\n- Compared to the likes of Corsair who are offering aluminum bodied keyboards, it does feel like Razer are behind in that aspect of giving you that extra value. Yes, the K70 and K95 Plat are better value for money, but I didn't get attached to the keycap fonts, nor the wrist rest (which looked like it would break easily). They looked like pretty awesome keyboards, but my gut was more attached to the Razer Blackwidow Chroma v2 (Whether that's because I had a Razer before, may be, maybe not, but I can tell you I was pretty divided when hitting that order button and took a while to make up my mind.\n- An extra two cables (2x USB + 1x 3.5mm audio) to plug in. I knew this before buying, but it's quite a culture shock for me, but not an issue. All they do is allow the passthroughs to work.\n- Sub-characters (if that's the find terminology?) on the keycaps like '?' and '%' are not backlit, which is slightly annoying if you're sitting in a darkened room, but most of the time I do not have any problem finding the right sub-character."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is my first mechanical gaming keyboard, I love the feel of the button presses and it is certainly clicky!\nThe keyboard has a good weight to it and has a metal base which makes it feel really premium! The wrist pad that comes with it is really comfy and has a really good grip to it as well. The keyboard almost feels like it is stuck to the desk when you push against it because of the weight and the rubber pads work really well!\nThe lights are cool, there's some effects I wasn't aware of such as the fire effect where the lights simulate a fire behind the keys which is quite nice and somewhat fitting to the season!\nThe cable is nicely placed, it is a really thick sturdy feeling cable too with two USBs and an audio jack, I believe you only need to plug both USBs in if you want to use the built in usb port, otherwise you only need to plug in one.\nThe three media buttons on the top right are quite nice, it is a bit weird that they are the only keys that do not have light pass through the patterns on them.\nMy razer synapsis didn't immediately detect the keyboard but that was fixed by uninstalling it and installing a newer version of the software.\nThe wrist pad came with a very small tear in it, it's barely noticeable except to touch as I can feel the bump which is a shame but it is still very nice!\nGreat keyboard and built very well! Feels very durable and would absolutely recommend!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I got this keyboard as I was building a gaming rig and wanted to have a nice clean RGB setup. This keyboard is amazing, I love all the colour combinations you can make, the software is fairly simple to use, however it took me some time to learn all the features of the Razer synapse.\nIt was the first time I purchased a tactile click keyboard and at first I found it quite noisy but after a few month of use it just sounded like background noise to me and didn't bother me much.\nI have noticed a few glitches in lighting sometimes, but these are very insignificant.\nThe unit is very well built with hard plastic and braided cable, one thing I dislike about the build design is how the kick stands are facing vertical and not horizontal, this results in the stands folding back in when I push my keyboard a little forward.\nThe price is also something which had me hesitant before buying, however I am happy with this purchase and feel as though it was a good buy."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I'm a massive gamer. My last keyboard was a razer but it was a cheap one so the colours could only cycle.\nThis one is so customisable! Once connected to the cloud and app, the keyboard automatically connects to the listed games. If you have the patience you can also customise it to make it do an insane amount of things.\nAny Overwatch player would LOVE this keyboard, it makes every character you play feel even more personal. I also have it set to custom settings so it does a variety of things when I'm not gaming.\nMods are available for certain games e.g. World of Warcraft, Stardew Valley, Minecraft that will change the keyboard's colours when you play the game.\nSeems expensive but if someone is really into their PC gaming this keyboard will definitely be worth the money. I cannot use any standard keyboard now without kind of feeling sorry for it for being so basic..."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This Keyboard is my upgrade from the RAZER BLACKWIDOW ULTIMATE 2013 And yes it was worth it! The one thing i love is the switches because the 2013 had Cherry Mx Blues and when i opened it and tried the RAZER GREEN SWITCHES Well lets just say i don't want to go back now. Totally worth it although the price maybe high for some if you ever get the money or have the money to buy this then please do. Razer Synapse is amazing because there so many effects to choose from and you can change each individual key to a certain colour. Some of the effects include Wave,Fire and Reactive there just 3 favourites of mine. You can even customise the colour of the effects and the speed to. So BUY IT !!!!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I've been through alot of mechanical keyboards but razer always seems to shine brighter than the rest \"literally\".\n Excellent build quality with a metal back plate and exposed switch design the key switches on this model are the upgraded Razer green switch (Razers version of a cherry MX blue switch) with sidewalls on the switch to make it more stable and resilient to dust. comes with a super comfy wrist rest that connects to the keyboard magnetically.\nSuper easy to setup just plug and play it should automatically install Razer synapse where you can customise lighting and create macros.\nmay be a bit expensive but if you have the money its 100% worth it"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Really excellent keyboard. It is worth noting that the keys are not silent, however they are much quieter than the standard Chroma keyboard. It’s your decision whether to pay the extra for that slightly less noisy click."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is the keyboard to end all other keyboards. The switches are nice and quiet and have a very good feel. The build quality is second to none also. I did have reservations initially with it being plastic but it feels solid and of a premium.\nI’ve been using this for 6 months now and am very pleased with it. The wrist rest is easily the comfiest one I’ve ever used. The RGB lighting is brilliant too. The Razer synapse app can be used to fully customise lighting, macros etc with ease.\nThe macro keys are brilliant for using in FPS games for quick healing. :)\nFor those wondering if you should pay the premium for a keyboard like this. The answer is yes, definitely buying one like this is an investment. You’ll be using the same keyboard for years to come."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This product compared to my last razer black widow chroma is such an amazing upgrade. Orange key switches reduce the loud type aound that many of my friends would complain about on discord while playing games , it looks amazing and the build quality is slick and durable. The wrist rest is the comfiest i jave ever used, the volume wheel on the keyboard itself has it's uses when playing games without a headset which has a volume wheel, however i dont use it much due to my headset having volume adjust. The gaps between keys now make cleaning it so much easier, which was also one of my requirements for purchasing a mechanical keyboard.\nIt was this or the huntsman elite and i'm so glad i went with the black widow elite"},{"rating":"3.0","content":"- Noticeably louder key clicks than previously owned logitech g710+ with similar switches.  To the point I would be self conscious typing while other people are asleep.\n- Extremely comfortable wrist rest.  If I could buy the rest separately I would buy 100 and use them as a pillow.\n- Solid feel, Good layout, sensible location of USB port.\n- Had repeated issues with the software resetting lighting setting every time PC rebooted.  Probably fixable and error on my part, but I gave up on it.  The functionality of the software was excellent though, and would be the best I'd used if it didn't keep resetting."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"The BlackWidow Chroma V2 is a fantastic keyboard - the keys feel great to press and the action is clean, the design is also beautiful especially when lit up which the huge array of lightsetups. It also allows custom light set ups to be made manually - I have already set up a custom fps key lighting scheme to play the tactical shooter 'Squad'.\nThe only downsides of the keyboard in my opinion would be the loudness of the key presses - it is louder than the average mechanical keyboard so something like this would not be suitable for someone streaming games on twitch or youtube.\nThe only other issue I can think of would be the placement of the alternative mouse keys on the far left - perhaps it just takes getting used to, but my left hand is used to reaching for the far left of the keyboard when pressing 'shift'/'ctrl'/tab' etc and with this keyboard I continually end up pressing the 'm1/2/3/4/5 buttons by accident."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"this keyboard is 100% the best keyboard in the world hands down,  you can feel the quality, it has three cables attached to it one is and audio cable which means you can plug the keyboard into your pcs headphone input then you can feed your headphones through the keyboard very easy\ngreat for fornite evrything , also has great comfortable leather style wrist rest"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Delivery was very swift with the keyboard arriving in a neat box. The build quality of this keyboard is paramount, having a smudge free metal finish, also including a very thick and long braided cable. Meanwhile, the Razer green switches feel brilliantly clickly and responsive while having bright LED’s which give the keyboard a lovely glow in any style you could think of (using synapse software). Perfect keyboard with perfect features."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Nice key board and as expected by Razer.. Wrist rest is magnetic and is optional. Personally I use the wrist rest. the keys are still quite clicky even though they are the orange tactile and silent type they are still loud\nI don't use the macro functions as I have no need for them at present for me the only thing that lets down the keyboard is the Razer synapse software"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"After using this keyboard for roughly 6 months now, I can honestly say money well spent. I love the feel of the Razer green switches and the customisation is awesome. Having per key lighting can be handy especially when making profiles for games where I only want to have certain keys lit.\nThe only problem I have with the keyboard is using the Synapse 3.0 software which is still in beta. I recommend using this keyboard with Synapse 2.0 until a final version of Synapse 3 is released."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"The product is great can't fault it and lucky for me the rain didnt get to it. however the way my package was dealt with and the fact I didn't know it was left by the bins is shocking. one of my house mates was in all day so would of heard the bell go off she didn't hear a thing. I come back to see that my package was just wedged behind the bins the following day was bin day so if I didn't notice my very nice keyboard would of been thrown in the trash.\ncontacted amazon directly about this but nothing came of it ...."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Bought for my gaming mad 15 year old son. He got an Omen gaming computer for Christmas and this was 'needed'.... Very well made and the lights behind the keys are AMAZING! Try the one that looks like fire... The gamer thinks it's dope whatever that means but I think it means great in teen-speak!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Let me just say that this is the best keyboard ever.\nThis is another Christmas present and I have to say that it was probaply the best. I have had to suffer from a £7 membrane for maybe 2 years and to change to a lovely mechanical keyboard which is from razer also was like a gift from heaven . Everything a keyboard has to offer this one has it and to the best quality. Not only is the keyboard to the best quality the razer chroma option is also fantastic especially with the new synapse 3 alowwibg even more colouring option which just tops everything off"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Nice keyboard, Well constructed. Love the\ntactile feel of the keys ( note that the orange keys are tactile and silent, and not the clicky type). They say keys are silent, but not as quiet as a membrane keyboard, so you do get a nice tactile bump. Wrist rest very comfortable."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Silent my arse, but it's a wonderful keyboard and much much quieter than my razer green switches that I have on the Orbweaver.\nA lovely keyboard with even better software.\n10/10"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"After using a cheap keyboard for a year I stopped in Currys and sampled this.  I ordered it the same night.  It is the best keyboard I have ever used."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great keyboard expected nothing less from razer. Nice tactile key presses although not as loud as compared to other cherry Mx blue switches. Great rgb colour choice although would prefer a downloadable software RGB controller rather than the synaps cloud but that has nothing to do with the keyboard. The wrist rest is by far the most comfortable i have used. Great functionality with included macro keys would highly recommend for gaming for long period of time."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Bought mine with the green switches. Not too loud but definitely still has a really nice click and bump. The RBG is easy to customise and the synapse 3 software is good to use. The software can stop working sometimes but when it works its great. The wrist rest is really comfortable, I never take it off. If you can get it for under £100 like I did then I would most certainly go for it."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I love the keyboard, I would not recommend any other. The keyboard is of good quality with comfortable keys and great software. The only down part is the wrist rest, it is comfortable I enjoy using it some people don't use it at all. But the problem with the wrist rest is that the feet of the wrist rest is starting to peel away from the glue. I am starting to notice the glue on the edges of the cushion is starting to show. Obviously, this would eventually happen over time if I am using it every day, but I have only had it less than 6 months.\nOther than that it is a great keyboard and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"It's a razer keyboard, so you pretty much know what you're going to get from the second you hear the name, it's a high-end mechanical keyboard with 3 different options of switches, personally I wish the body was some kind of metal as opposed to a plastic shell but oh well."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This has been my dream keyboard for so long now, absolutely love it and I'm not going to be letting go of it for a very good while. The soft wrist support is brilliant, just a shame the magnets aren't a bit stronger as I do find myself pulling it off occasionally"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"What can you say, just an awesome keyboard, one of the best around. Yellow keys aren't as quiet as I thought they'd be. My M800 is quieter. As M800 is no longer around this is the top line keyboard to get!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"A brilliant product. The keyboard is so easy to use. Before now I've always used the cheap  10-15 pound keyboards. And felt a mechanical keyboard would take some getting use to.  But no. The keyboard feels great.  It is still pretty loud even though i bought the silent and tactile one but not a huge issue.  5 Stars!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great keyboard - love the sound (of clicks), lighting and the
