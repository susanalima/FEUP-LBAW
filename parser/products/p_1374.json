Weve had Lenovo before and they seem just fine - better than the real budget laptops, but not necessarily the build quality of high end more expensive ones.

No problems recommending for student or basic office use."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought this myself and I'm glad I waited until Christmas to open it. It was worth the wait.
