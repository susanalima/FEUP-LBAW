I've had chromebooks before, so thought I knew what to expect, but this model has a few hidden features which make it much better. My children use is regulalry and accidents do happen, but this chromebook has a spill resisitant keyboard, which has saved us several times already. It's also survived serveral bumps and bands without a scratch. It's very portable so has been great for taking on holiday. Thouroughly recomend."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"My first Chromebook and I'm so glad I made the decision to give up Microsoft and all the bloatware they include on the average laptop. Today I found out that my child's school has bought one for every single pupil so that says it all really.\nInstant start up and power down. Apps run smoothly, so many to choose from, same as on my phone.\nThrilled with this."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I think this is a great Chromebook.  I am pleasantly surprised.  I spend more than I planned and opted for the 64 gig memory given that Google is now integrating the apps into the Chromeverse: but well worth it as you can spend £100 less on a rubbish outdated machine or get this 2 in 1 masterpiece. So where do I start ? 1. The screen: great, great. There is some reviewer who says the screen is poor, well they are LIARS, a dirty LIAR. For starters I? have had low-end Chromebooks and the screens have been terrible, this 11.6\" is clear, bright, colours are good and the angle is not bad, and it is a touch screen !!!!!  Ok its is a small screen, 13\" 14\" is the optimum size for a chrome book, but all said this will definitely fit in your bag.  2.Speed , for a low powered Celeron processor this machines handles numerous tabs open, much better than my old Toshiba 2.  Runs Android / Chrome apps also well. Have not tested with games, as this is not my thing, but remember ,  Android apps are geared towards mobile power so this Chrome book should do just fine.  3.Keyboard, is Ok, a bit small (but the computer is small) but seems of good quality, 4.Speakers are Ok, but they are downward facing (which makes no sense to me); 5.completely versatile, flip into V for Netflix watching or presentations or turn into a tablet mode; 6.Battery is good as you would expect. 7.Build: sold (as you would expect, as this is expected to sell into the education market).  Conclusion: if you are happy with the size (this is 11.6\") then I would highly recommend this machine: well done Dell!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I've used this laptop for a month or so now and all I can say is Wow!\nI previously had an ancient clunky huge 15.4\" laptop that had become a drain to use which prompted me to look for something new.\nThis laptop doesn't disappoint. Yes it's a chromebook but if you've looked into that side of it and that suits you then I think this laptop will be great for you. I love that all documents will be backed up online. I only really use a laptop for printing/editing some small docs and internet browsing.\nIt's a nice size, not too small, and I'm able to hold it out in one hand with little stress on my wrist. I carry it around everywhere in my handbag and it's not a strain on my shoulder, randomly it fits in there perfectly! (Hadn't planned that!)\nI've watched Netflix on it in the car with it on the dashboard, my daughter sits in the back and can see/hear it perfectly and it plays it well."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"The display is awful, the worst I've come across on a Dell product.  On a laptop, I would normally position the screen just past 90 degrees.  For the Chromebook, the angle was more like 135 degrees between screen and keyboard to get a display that was acceptable and didn't look washed out.  Had to use all but full screen brightness as well.  Very disappointed.  Product returned for a refund."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great little machine for traveling.  It's a little heavy, but that's because it's well made.\nIf you use Chrome as your regular browser on your home PC, the Chromebook comes up instantly  (after you enter your email account) and you are up  -- nothing more to do.  Stays in sync with you home PC too.  You should be using something like POCKET to keep your bookmarks synced.\nFast,  you're in Chrome after 2 seconds of entering your email password.  This is a great auxiliary machine for the price and functionality; far better than carrying an big mobile. Watch you favorite films on the train or plane, (put them on a USB key),  and keep in touch with your Chrome browser life, all your tabs are automatically there; Netflix, Facebook, etc.  No problems with catching public WiFi. Or use your cell phone in Tethering mode as a WiFi server.  The HMDI port allows you view your movies (or streamed videos, Netflix, etc) on a large screen - when I travel, I can continue watching a Netflix series or share a movie with friends at the hotel room.\nWouldn't recommend a chrome book for a main home machine as you'll be missing all the great software that Windows runs."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Wow wow wow!

Have been using my Chromebook for two days now and am very pleased. Very happy that I can read my Amazon magazines the Kindle app. Not so happy that I cant use Microsoft office apps without a subscription - however the Google Docs and Sheets apps are just as good for everyday use and will open and edit Microsoft Office files.
