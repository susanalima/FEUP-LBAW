Opening I found a small but well proportioned keyboard not unlike a game pad! Keys are responsive and cable for charging is included! There is also a dongle in the battery compartment which, as I understand, is a Bluetooth dongle for computers or devices that have USB but no built in Bluetooth.\nAll in all I really like this little keyboard, which arrived today!\nSo far I have managed to pair it to my fire stick and my iPad which, by the way, is what I have written this entire review on much quicker than I normally could! It is very light but works a treat and I have no problems recommending it to anyone looking for this type of keyboard!\nHope that helps, have a great day =)"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought this for my amazon fire stick, some apps require a cursor something the little amazon left right up down remote does not support. I also wanted a keyboard so this device is excellent! Setting up was easy! I went into settings then into devices and added a new input device and hit the pair button the remote... simples!\nThe battery recharges quickly and if you open the battery panel there is a little Bluetooth usb dongle for devices which do not have Bluetooth built in.\nHighly recommended!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I've only had this keyboard a couple of days, but I'm so pleased with it that I am giving my initial impression right away. I will update the review at a later stage regarding the Rii's long-term robustness.\nAfter struggling, without success, to pair my Anker keyboard with my new Linx tablet (Windows 8.1, as it was on my previous tablet with which I'd been using the same Anker keyboard), I decided to give up, bite the bullet, and get a different keyboard. After a long search I decided that the Anker was actually still the best (particularly given its good price) but, obviously, I didn't want to risk getting a new one only to find that this version of 8.1 wouldn't deal with the Anker keyboard at all.\nSo I decided to try a completely different keyboard when I came across the Rii i8. It isn't much to spend on the offchance and the reviews were good, so I took the plunge.\nI'm very glad I did. The keyboard paired with the tablet immediately, without my having to do anything (including using the included dongle) other than pressing the Bluetooth connection button on the keyboard while the tablet was in pairing mode. The keyboard was recognised, and immediately started working properly.\nDuring the set-up process of the new tablet I had to reboot frequently, as is usual. Each time the Rii keyboard was right there and ready, from the first keypress, to talk to the tablet.\nThe response is so good, and having a QWERTY layout is so user-friendly, that I've actually turned off the touchscreen facility on the tablet. Whatever I want to do (typing, recording and activating macros, mousing, cursoring, keyboard shortcuts, etc.), I can do on the Rii. If I want to control video playback there are dedicated buttons for that. All the function keys work normally - there's nothing missing at all. This keyboard has all the functions of my full-sized desktop keyboard.\nThe only drawbacks are that the keyboard is US layout - but then many keyboards are so it's easy to compensate for that because you just get used to it. Then there is the fact that I'm left-handed and the keyboard is geared for right-handers; again, so are most input devices (and everything else in the constructed world...) and I'm used to adapting. (Annoyed, but used to it...)\nThe keys are definite, almost 'clicky' so you know when you've pressed them. Obviously the keyboard isn't big enough for touch typing, but it's definitely big enough to allow for either hunt-and-pick or the thumb-keying most people use on their smartphones.\nThe trackpad is probably very good - I'm so bad with trackpads that I can't give a fair idea, except to say that I've found this one easier than many full-sized laptop trackpads.\nThere are two sets of left and right 'mouse buttons', so you can decided to click left and right with one hand or with two. The mouse wheel is catered for in the centre of the trackpad, and is marked by a blue path which you can see if you look closely. There are dedicated buttons for e-mail, for muting sound, launching your browser and magnifying, plus a Windows button which can not only be used in the usual combinations such as Windows+D to get to the desktop etc., but also takes you straight to the 'charms' when pressed - so much quicker than sliding from the right and then tapping.\nThere's even a Ctl+Alt+Delete button! The Enter button performs this combination if used with the blue function (Fn) key - useful.\nThe keyboard is light (considerably lighter than my Anker) and easy to hold in all respects. It slips easily into a bag, or even a pocket or handbag. There's a definite on/off button, so there's no worry about keys activating something when the keyboard is tucked into a bag or pocket, and you know you're conserving charge.\nThe Rii recognises all my created macros and shortkeys just as well as my full-sized (extremely expensive, completely ergonomic) keyboard, too. So all in all this is the easiest, most sure way of operating a tablet, particularly on the go, that I've come across.\nAt this price for a fully-functioning and even do-everything keyboard with total portability, you can't lose. I'm tempted to get a separate one with a backlight to tuck into my hospital/emergency bag as well - nothing worse than being awake on a darkened ward, or in a shared room, and unable to use your tablet properly.\nDo get one. Even if you decide not to use it with your tablet, look at all the other devices this amazing little keyboard will work!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought this keyboard to use as a method of controlling a nexus 7 tablet that has developed an intermittent fault with the touch interface. I a nutshell, the device has fulfilled all I wanted it to do and more.\nIn more detail... The keyboard arrives in tidy and efficient packaging. The instructions are scant, but suggest charging it for 20-30 minutes before first use. I did this (off a computer USB socket, so at a lower charging rate than using a phone charger) and it took a little longer than 30 minutes to fully charge.\nThe keyboard is nicely built, it feels very tactile and the keys have a nice click, to provide a good feedback. I was a little concerned (before receiving the keyboard) that it would feel like typing on a ZX spectrum with that dead flesh feel, bu this really isn't the case.\nThe touch pad too is nicely responsive - a little small for doing intricate work, but more than adequate for general use.\nThere are also two sets of left/right click buttons, which makes the layout of the keyboard extremely flexible.\nTwo finger scrolling works - it's very fast, but always registers that I'm using two fingers.\nI also like the pair of circular pads to the top left and top right. The top left is a media control (Up/Down is volume, left/right is previous/next and the centre button is play/pause). The top right pad is a cursor pad, where the centre button is an ok, or select button.\nAfter 20 minutes of that charge, I paired it to my tablet and it just worked. No great detail to feedback with relation to this, but if you are looking to control an android touch device that works perfectly well other than the touch interface, I can vouch that this is a great solution (it makes the tablet a mini, wall mount PC in my case).\nIt would also be an ideal solution for a media centre PC or similar, where you want to carry out basic interface interactions with a PC at a distance, but don't really want a mouse and keyboard hanging around all the time.\nDon't expect to be able to touch type with this - it wouldn't be ideal for writing lengthy articles simply due to the size of the keyboard, but as a discrete PC/Android input device, it's great!"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"It’s a good quality keyboard and it looks quite smart the Bluetooth function works well and it’s easy to set up it does struggle to pick up the doggle that comes with it though and it doesn’t work on all smart TVs as it doesn’t on mine it works on amazon fire sticks with an easy Bluetooth set up that links together with ease it has a nice feeling to it and all the buttons seem to be perfectly placed and you can get to know what’s where after 15-20mins of using it  overall very pleased not quite 5 stars as it doesn’t pick up my tv and the doggle supplied does have its issues picking up the keyboard I would recommend it but check what you want to use it for first to ensure you get what you need"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Very responsive touch pad, fast but not too fast that the cursor is flying all over the place, the up and down arrows function brilliantly as a scroll wheel.\nEasy to pair. I don't mind the Yank keyboard layout. Looks very nice and fits my hands nicely, I have big hands.\nI like the little extras that are included like a bluetooth reciever in the back compartment that you can take out and plug in to a usb device, plus a li-ion battery that you can change! It also works while charging and has an and off switch.\nThe one thing that I'd add to the device is a shift button on the right hand side.\nApart from that, amazing!"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Super quick delivery by Amazon Prime as usual. The touch pad doesn’t work with the iPad which was a nuisance. I got it for the touch pad to control the iPad remotely but that doesn’t work. Not the fault of the keypad.  I read that the iPad doesn’t support touch pads apart from it’s own screen; whereas Android does and gives you a pointer on the screen to give you almost total control remotely. As for the iPad,I tested the letter keys which appear to work and the volume keys. That’s as far as I got before  transfering my attention to the Android tablet. This is not a bad review for the product itself which is very useful. I just knocked a star off because, I believe, in one of the questions someone says it works on iOS but that should be “partially works” on iOS. Unfortunately this means I now have to buy a larger newer Android tablet. Apple inadvertently promotes the sale of Android devices? Ha Ha."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Having used many of these mini keyboards for different devices over the last decade, some feel cheap and tacky some are just useless...\nThis is neither, it feels very nice to hold is a good weight without being too heavy for someone like myself with chronic pain issues, the keys are in a good position for fast thumb typing and also feel good. The touch pad is really responsive which was a surprise as they're normally in my  experience terrible.\nIt paired over bluetooth very easily with my windows 10 tablet, an android tablet and a pc.\nAs its an American layout just need to make sure you change your device to the same.\nMy girlfriend has already stolen it so i need to buy another one now =)"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"The keyboard arrived on time and was packaged very well. The instructions are brief but give enough information on how to install and pair device. I have only had the device for a few days with low use age so can’t really comment on battery life. The unit is easily charged by its own mini USB lead. It was already pre-charged and took about 20 minutes to reach full capacity.\nThe keyboard is easy to read and pairyto my Sony smart tv in seconds. All spears tone working without any issues. Definitely would recommend. Good quality at a reasonable price."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Brilliant!\nSo light and compact.\nThe touch pad is really responsive, the button are not super clonky. Works great.\nI use it with my Samsung galaxy Tablet. It paired with the Bluetooth instantly and was usable immediately.\nIf you want a keyboard that you can carry around, then this is definitely it.\nI am so glad that I bought this one.\nEasy to use.\nLight.\nCompact without being silly small.\nBluetooth easy to use.\nResponsive touch pad.\nQuick charge.\nFast delivery."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"This review is for the Bluetooth keyboard.\nI bought this 2015 New Released Bluetooth Version Rii i8 keyboard from Amazon yesterday and it works well with both my laptop and also  with the Amazon fire TVstick.\nIf you intend using it on a fire TV stick you do need a bit of knowledge about side loading apps because you must first download a 'settings apk' and side load it onto the fire tv before you can install the keyboard, details if needed will more than likely be found on YouTube\nIt pairs with the new 4K Fire tv box simply by the main menu without the need to sideload the settings apk.\nMake sure you buy the bluetooth keyboard if intending to use it on a fire tv stick and not the other 2.4GHz RF version that has a USB dongle because it's not Bluetooth and will NOT work.\nA warning that should come with this keyboard is it does NOT come with a bluetooth receiver dongle so if your intended device is not bluetooth it will not work."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Having a Amazon Fire TV I found I needed both the supplied remote and a keyboard. The keyboard was big. This has nearly all the controls of the remote and the letters of the keyboard. One device for nearly everything. There is no button for one function (that I've found). So far I have found it really useful. Durability will be the major factor but after one day it is a little too early to judge. I would commend this product highly. The tracking pad and mouse functions make the device superior to the original remote. Side loaded apps not designed for Fire TV but require a mouse suddenly become easy to use."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Brilliant Bluetooth keyboard, I use it with my first gen prime stick, and it connected easily, and works flawlessly, after a short while of non use, u get a little notice saying the keyboard has gone to sleep mode, when you press any key, it reconnects without delay..I like it a lot and happily recommend it..!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought this as a Bluetooth accessory for my Pi Zero.\nPaired without issue. Easy to use. The trackpad is excellent.\nBut. Some keys are not recognised by the Pi. The solution is to open  terminal window and enter\nsetxkbmap us &\nOr you can at this command to the end of the Autorun file.\nThen all keys will be read."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Bought this to replace an almost exact replica, unlike the old one though it didn't require or even work with the dongle. Fortunately my old controller is just damaged not broken so after pairing the controller to the nvidia shield it works flawlessly.\nUpdate, battery lasts hours and the keyboard has become unresponsive after a few presses and needs to be switched off and on."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is a very neat little device.\nI have been using it with my Android tablet, with my Android phone, and with the built in Bluetooth of my Raspberry Pi 3\nThings I like:\n* form factor, the device is a good size in the hand, and is comfortable to use. I think probably better than those with the touchpad at one end.\n* size, it's only slightly bigger than my phone\n* texture, it has a smooth / soft finish\n* it comes with a USB Bluetooth adaptor, if your desired device lacks built in Bluetooth (which fits neatly inside the battery cover when not in use)\n* the keys feel nice to type with, although obviously not as good as a full size keyboard\n* it's a pretty complete keyboard, not just letters. I am able to admin my server via SSH on my tablet using tilde (~) and pipe (|) etc.\nThings I don't like:\n* lack of back light, maybe I should have got the newer version, but I was keen to have Bluetooth\n* Mini USB for charging, rather than the more common Micro. Means I need a specific cable to charge this keyboard, rather than the many Micro USB I already have for phones, my mouse, etc.\n* Touch pad scrolling is a bit hit and miss. things tend to jump about a lot unless you hold with one finger and move the other by very small amounts\nTips:\n* [Fn] + [space] toggles the touch pad speed, which was far too slow for me to start with\n* You don't need to use the mouse buttons, just tap the pad to click\nIt turns itself off is not used for a while, hit a key and it wakes up (no need to use the power switch)\nOverall, I'm very pleased with the keyboard, and have enjoyed using it."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"the track pad is a bit hard to use but overall it is a nice device to have especially if you have a firestick/tv as this makes the perfect companion. Used for a couple of months now and not had a problem with it and battery life is long. It does switch off itself after a fairly short time of inactivity but I guess it saves the battery."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Bluetooth keyboard with 99% of the use of normal keyboards. No hassle connecting with Raspberry Pi 3b. No loss of connection and also good battery life!\n Rechargeable battery is the biggest bonus to this!\nGood build quality and Matte effect rubber grip gives good feel and general grip.\nWould definitely buy again!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Paired straight away to my firestick makes navigating mobdro showbox easy as the mouse function is OK easier than the the firestick remote toggle mouse that can be used i have downloaded other apps using es file manager with Google search engine as a book mark bril piece of kit"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Very good quality, does the job. Trackpad takes some getting use to it, and key strokes aren’t as soft as I’d like or be used to from a normal keyboard, but it’s still a very good built. Works perfectly with Nvidia Shield Tv and with a Firestick TV too."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"i wanted something which can fit my palm n operate my laptop..\nvery happy with this..\nseamlessly connects to my dell laptop samsung smart tv n samsung tablets..\nthe integrated mouse pad is a very nice feature n u can deactivate it if u dont need it which is even better..\n100%. recommended"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This little device is great if you have a living room media PC. It was recognised by Windows without any third-party drivers to install. Range is good; I can use it on the sofa while the PC is on the other side of a large living room. Trackpad works as you'd expect, not the quality of a high end laptop, but functional and responsive. It just about does multi-touch, but it's often easier to use the directional arrows on the right side.\nThe whole unit feels well made and the battery seems to last for a long time. The device auto powers off after a minute or so. All round solid product and good value for money."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"So good, I have just ordered another one.\nThe keys are easy to use, even doing things like dragging files around.\nI have tested this both on the laptop, which we use as a source for video and on a Samsung Smart TV.  Both work well and, while you can't use the keyboard to type into Netflix on the TV, suing the arrow keys on the keyboard is much faster than using the TV's remote control."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I wanted a keyboard that worked with the Amazon Fire TV Stick...I found it. Combine this with the free Mozilla Firefox app for the stick and you can browse the web properly through your TV. This keyboard also works great if you want to sit back from your PC - the mouse pad also works pretty well surprisingly."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Recommended by my neighbour - purchased a month or so ago and haven't been disappointed - it's Bluetooth connected very easy and has been reliable - just takes a little time to figure out what all the buttons do but very useful for controlling some AV gear in my bedroom."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"It was supposed to arrive with a usb charge cable, but it wasn’t included.
