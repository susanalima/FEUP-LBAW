Very much plug and go. Had no issues faffing around with drivers. It just worked.\nI thought it might annoy me slightly that it went to sleep after a period of not being used. But the mechanism of waking it up is very natural and works immediately.\nI'd seen some reviews complaining that it wasn't the most sensitive for very fine movements. I haven't found this to be the case myself. I'm sure it's less sensitive than the high end gaming mice. But at this price, that's to be expected.\nFinally, the go-back and go-forward buttons on the side are brilliant. I use them all the time navigating the internet and files. I get annoyed now when I use a regular mouse that doesn't have this feature.\nHighly recommend. I'm going to buy another one of these for work so I don't have to be carrying it back and forth."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great medium size wireless mouse. I couldn't find the Nano-receiver at first, but it's plugged into the base of the mouse. I put the receiver into my laptop's USB port and it connected with the mouse immediately (I'm using Windows 10). The DPI default setting is fine for me, so I haven't changed it - but 5 settings are available. Also, there are Forward and Back buttons on the side of the mouse.\nUsually, I prefer a full size mouse. (This one is smaller than my two existing full size mice.) However, I find this one comfortable to use and in some respects a bit easier to handle than the more bulky full size mice. This VicTsing mouse is sensitive and responsive. The mouse switches off automatically when the PC or laptop is switched off or when the Nano receiver is removed from the USB port. The mouse is powered by a single AA battery (not supplied).\nWireless signal has proved very reliable. I have not experienced any interruptions while using this mouse.\nFor the price, this is an excellent and comfortable wireless mouse."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I purchased this item on the 04/07/2017 from Amazon & it arrived within the allocated timescale, it was certainly well packaged to prevent damage in transit. I bought this product for my laptop as the in built pad is loosing its responsiveness. Setting up was simplicity itself, insert a AA battery, slide the wwireless plug into a vacant USB slot (& here's the good bit) Windows 10 picks it up & builds a driver for it so no need for a CD & installing\n drivers. In under a minute it was working fine, what more could you ask for?. Build quality is excellent, the mouse is very responsive but not overly so. At £6.99 it's a steal & is excellent VFM, I would definitely recommend this mouse & would use the seller again."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Love this mouse. Wanted one that was not fully ergonomic yet still comfortable. It is so soft and only needs one AA battery which has lasted me for 4 months now and is still going. I like that you can set the cursor sensitivity with the mouse and that it shuts off after a few minutes with no activity so saves the battery. You do have to remember to click first to get it to turn back on.\nAll round excellent mouse."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Great value, in fact...hard to beat for the money!\nThe mouse works perfectly fine for the average user browsing the web. No real complaints at all. For the price you really can't expect much, but it's surprisingly ergonomic (Although this obviously varies per person), surprisingly well made and it also works straight away on both windows 7 + 10.\nIf you're the sort of person who 'sometimes' uses photoshop, does a little word processing or web design etc then it may not be 'just' as good a buy. There is an ever so slight 'dead spot' if you slowly move the mouse, which leaves the cursor immobile on screen. Also the scroll wheel sometimes doesn't register.\nBut these two above points are still acceptable if you only do the odd bit of that kind of work. If you did that kind of work more regularly/seriously then it would probably be less acceptable. Anything other than pro work, it's great!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Our Second purchase of this item ..simply because it works well when combined with a decent AA (yes AA) rechargeable battery, ..for heavy pc users such as ourselves the frustration of constantly swapping over 2x AAA batteries (as typically pc mice are kitted out with) they just don't hold charge, ..this does, we have to really think...do I need to change the battery? ..when did I change the battery?\nI'm a money miser where pc mice are concerned, having paid out for some right old crud (thanks for nothing microsoft) ..so to come across a seemingly decent, functional mouse with 6 buttons is good, ..so good I'll have two thanks very much ;)"},{"rating":"1.0","content":"I was after a cheap, aesthetically pleasing keyboard with reasonably thin, chiclet-esq keys. Unfortunately, this keyboard didn't meet my expectations - at all.\nFirstly, the keys were not as thin and snappy/responsive as I had hoped, and after 2 days of use, the backspace key and right arrow key are not functional and have stuck in the depressed position. Not a very good purchase at all, very disappointed."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"For just under 7 quid I think this us the best mouse I have ever had. i have used Microsoft ones which were fine but I didn't want to spend £25.\nThis mouse feel nice in the hand and works very well, all day. Its good even when using graphics programs and design software where tiny controlled movements are required.\nI like the way it goes to sleep after about 6 mins of inactivity, there isn't an annoying on/off switch to worry about. I just roll the wheel to re-activate.\nSo I did buy one for work and liked it so much that I bought a second one for home."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Never used to use a mouse when using my laptop, but since getting this mouse I can't live without it.\nFor the price it's very high quality and works flawlessly. Small enough to fit into a pocket in my bag, but still comfortable in the hand.\nIt turns off when you haven't used it for a while and turns back on with a simple click, which is good for battery life.\nOnly negative is the placement of the DPI changer button, I need to reset it to the lowest speed every time I take it out of my bag because it's been accidentally pressed in transport."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Basic but functional cordless mouse (a hamster then?? 🐹 )\nVery smooth In operation and plug n play that works rather than plug n pray. Just install 1x AA battery, plug in the USB receiver dongle to a USB port and away you go.\nThere is no power off button so if you don't feel the mouse will be used for a bit, store it with the battery removed.\nOverall, great value for money and does what you need, it may not be gaming standard but great for web browsing and office use."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"A very good delivery service, arrived the same day as advertised. This is a full sized keyboard with numeric keypad and all the other features you find on full sized versions. The keys have a fairly light resistance so you have the feedback feel which is reassuring, however they do have a fairly long press which I personally like but some may not. This was bought as a standby as I recently had problems with the on screen keyboard. I do however recommend this item."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I've ordered a few of these in the past and they've all been great. I had an issue with my last one which was resolved by the excellent customer service team. Faultless service. The mouse Feels good in the hand and the cursor speed can be changed with the button on top. It has a power save function to ensure battery life is good"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"A no frills keyboard - plastic does not feel very rugged, stripped wire was used instead of cable ties and on first use one of the legs dropped off (but was easily replaced).\nHowever this was essential in helping me solve a bios issue that I was not able to resolve with my high tech glow in the dark all singing and dancing keyboard.\nFor the price this is absolutely fine."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This mouse is just what I needed to replace a much loved mouse that went to the great mouse mat in the sky. to my surprise this one is much better, more responsive and it just glides over the mat much easier than my old one. I have left the two left hand buttons in default mode as I have not yet thought of a reason to download and alter the functions of the buttons. I would buy this product again without any hesitation, it is a very good product."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Had this for a while now and I have to say I am very pleased with it. Does exactly what you would expect from a wireless mouse quick click to wake it up and off we go again mousing all over the place. Works on mouse pad and arm of chair when I am feeling lazy.\nOverall pleased with packaging, delivery and very pleased with this item"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Arrived ahead of delivery time and well packaged, first impression had a comfortable feel and connected to my Android tablet with no problems. Review amended 07.11.16.. It now appears a manufacturing fault could cause a slight problem when used with Android tablets ie.\nno onscreen keyboard activation however for use on a PC whether laptop or desktop this mouse is an excellent choice  This problem should not reflect on the unexpectedly good service of this company."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Fantastic mouse. Over the past year I've had to buy maybe six different keyboards(that usually come with a mouse) and I've had to send them all back because of their poor performance, largely their connection.\nBut this mouse I have used the whole time, it has outperformed all the cheap ones you get with wireless keyboards.\nBattery life is great, never have any connectivity issues either.\nIf only I could have such luck with keyboards..."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This is a medium size mouse. I'm using it on my MacBook Pro and it worked straight away, no installing of any software or drivers. I like that you can adjust the speed of the pointer with just the push of a button. What more is there to say about a mouse, other than it feels very ergonomic and is very responsive. I would definitely recommend it to others."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"Arrived on time and sellers contacted me to ensure I had received the item and was happy. It is very light and not that big but does the job well, so far. Only slight problem would be the speed of the mouse is very fast and altering the computer settings doesn't seem to affect it. So from that point of view it can't have 5 stars"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"there is a small usb transmitter plugged into the base of the mouse. pull it free of the mouse , pug it into a spare USB port in the laptop, make sure ther is a battery in the mouse and away you go. You can still use the mouse pad on the laptop. There is no clever stuff to do, it works straight away......brilliant for this luddite!!!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"The best thing about this mouse is the auto sleep function. That and the single AA battery give excellent battery life and function. Leave the mouse come back later and click a button and it is awake. I have just ordered another one as this is far superior to the one I was using for the family computer. That one requires 2 AAA batteries and can't function on rechargeables for long before the low charge light comes on. This mouse however has great functional performance as described and reflected in other reviews. I can not find fault with it."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"A great mouse at a great price. Installed in 30 seconds after which a software update automatically appeared and I installed this with no problems. I have large hands so it is a little small but apart from that, excellent.\nI have been using this mouse for eight hours. It is perfect and deserves 5 stars. Less than £10, amazing. I would have paid a lot more."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"It was the first time I buy a VicTsing product. All I can tell you is that it won't be the last time!\nReally great quality product. Fits perfectly and compared to my ex Logitech mini mouse, this one is ... hum... really better!\nThe only disappointment is to have waited that long to buy it!\nThanks VicTsing, I fall in love with your products!"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"This mouse has everything a mouse should have, except for on/off switch, which is convenient when you close your laptop's lid and don't want it to wake up because of mouse movements. But the mouse turns off automatically instead. All the buttons and scroll wheel work good. Scroll wheel has ratchet which is the right strength. Top plastic is soft touch.\nI wish it was a little bit longer, but it's high enough to almost compensate it."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"I bought this because it was the best seller when I searched for left handed mouse. However it is not a left handed mouse. Sure the mouse is designed symmetrically so either hand can use it, but the extra buttons are on the left side of the mouse, so useless for a left hander. I am not giving it enough of a try to see if its a decent mouse, just sending it straight back."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"It works just fine, so no complaints about that.\nFor the money I can't really complain, but I would say it does feel a bit cheap in the hand. Not a big surprise on something so cheap, really.\nFor my purposes, which is just to have a spare for use with a laptop when making some presentations, it's ideal."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"It was good to start with - but now slightly frustrating to use as there is no on/off button, it takes a while for the mouse to respond. Not sure if its broken or bad connection. The scroll wheel is malfunctioning. A shame really as have only been using it for three weeks. Spend a bit more get a better one."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"absolutely brilliant! i actually can't believe how well it works as there is some dodgy comments below, but the mouse is perfect!\nit works as soon as you plug in the USB and the quality is great.\nno need for bluetooth or any add-ons"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Really nice product. Great, pricise control. Ideal for Left or Right handed use. Great energy saving 'no use' sleep mode. I'm still on my first battery (not supplied) after 2 months use  & there's no sign of it running out of power.\nNeed an inexpensive wireless mouse?
