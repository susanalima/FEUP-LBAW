I've been using laptops and computers for years. This is just a very basic simple laptop for browsing and opening a few files literally nothing else. As for it has no room for Windows. I don't know where anyone gets that from. It does take a couple of days for the updates and the computer to set up properly. But I also have a very powerful computer that is exactly the same when I bought it I I wouldn't recommend putting any programs on this. Just use apps from the app store. It's basically a tablet with a keyboard. The only thing I would say is if you're someone who looks at the windows updating. It does update all the security properly. But there is a file that it won't download it's got something to do with the overall Windows update. I wouldn't really worry about that. As long as the Windows Defender updates. Maybe that's when people are saying that it's not big enough to update the windows. Well the Windows update that you're going to get on this system frankly isn't going to make any difference. If you want just a basic laptop to do a few little bits this will do fine. But for people that use big apps and games I wouldn't bother."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Do not buy this the hard drive is only 32 gigabytes which is too small to run windows 10 updates. As soon as windows tries to update your drive is full and your laptop is a brick. These should be withdrawn from the market as not fit for purpose. I‚Äôve been building and repairing pcs as a business for 20 years and these things are a rip off. You cannot even update the drive as it is built into the motherboard and cannot be replaced."},{"rating":"2.0","content":"Be aware that the Microsoft 365 is only a trial. Although the description suggests a 1 yr subscription, that is only for the 1TB storage, 365 is NOT anything other than a trial software. I am disappointed and feel duped"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This was bought for basic emailing, office stuff, word documents, that sort of thing. So far it does everything well. It comes with Office 365 which you have to pay for after a while. I chose to uninstall this and put on an earlier Microsoft Office package to avoid the repeat fees. I also chose not to have the 1TB of cloud storage as I prefer to have my data actually on my computer, so I put a high quality 32GB micro SD card in the slot and doubled the storage. I can't really fault anything so far!"},{"rating":"1.0","content":"i read the reviews but gave it a try as there was a good deal and never had any problem with HP in the past.\nOnly needed an extra laptop when i work remotely (so not the main use) . worked ok for 2 months then stopped charging this morning. Spoke to Amazon and they said there is a hardware issue with this model so will get the money back. ok with this but this doesn't replace the laptop and i now need to search for a new one. So not extremely happy and will look for something better now.\nProbably best to invest in something with a higher qualify and storage. all depends what you need it for"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"i normally only write reviews when i'm pissed, but this product deserves some praise, especially at the discount price i've got it for. the many bad reviews are all to do with running windows on a machine with 32gb storage and limited processing power! whoever came up with that idea must be insane! instead, i haven't even touched the installed windows, but have replaced it with Lubuntu 18.04 on the very first run. wiped the laptop completely and ended up with an awesome machine that is a joy to use! remember, it must be 18.04 if you want everything to work out of the box!\npros:\nthin, lightweight, large bright screen, small bezzel, really nice design, decent keyboard, track pad feels awkward but gets better with use...\ncons:\nquality not as good as with previous streams! sd card doesn't click and lock, so no longer ideal for memory expansion! there is no power light on the power button. all the external connectors seem rushed and are difficult to use. speakers  often produce horrible high pitched noise, probably due to being made too small to handle the power.\nin conclusion:\nfor the price, i can't complain! once Lubuntu is installed, it really does everything I want it to do, and does it good! the only thing it could handle better are hd videos running at 60fps. up to 720p@60fps or up to 1080p@30fps everything is fine, above that it struggles as i think Lubuntu doesn't make use of on-board gpu. although given the screen resolution there is no need to go above 720! for the smoothest youtube experience i recommend using sm player and sm youtube extension. there, even the contrast, saturation etc. can be adjusted... liberty office is way easier to use than office 365! you don't need to register and it's free! so is most other stuff for linux. Lubuntu is very customisable, looks better than windows. so there's my advice. don't be stuck with windows."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"beautiful colour as pictured. lightweight and portable. easy to use with up to date features. cheaper than most. couldn't be happier :)"},{"rating":"2.0","content":"Very disappointed with this item.

As others have said, you can only download programmes from within the windows store.if you prefer particular apps / browsers/ search engines check whether the Windows store offers them before you choose this laptop.
