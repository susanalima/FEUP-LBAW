The mouse is quite small and light compared to a 'regular' full size one, yet isn't as small as other nano mice you can buy for tablets and netbooks. I have found the shape to be ergonomically designed; it fits in my palm comfortable and the small smooth grooves in the left and right buttons help keep my fingers in place and makes clicking down easier also. To get going, you just pull the plastic strip out that's preventing the battery from connecting, plug the tiny nano receiver in to a regular 2.0 USB slot, and away you go. I love the plug & play aspect of this as there's no timely configuration required. It only requires 1 AA battery, which is included, hence the lighter weight of the mouse.

I've had other mouses before, more expensive ones, that at the end of the day will cause me some pain on my hand, and this one never did it. Really ergonomic! So now, after more than 4 years of use, 8 hours a day, the right key of the mouse started having some issues, meaning that still works fine but you need to press it harder to work. I guess some dirt might be causing some problems. So I just ordered 2 more M185's, one for me and one for my wife, and they just work superbly!
