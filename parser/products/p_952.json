I found my way to the high end audio section, and found a pair of these bad boys. I loaded up a track on my phone (aware that the 470ohm would almost definitely not be satisfied with an iphone's amplifier) and instantly fell in love. I had never heard such clarity and punch, without sounding incredibly coloured. BUT they were £325. Definitely off the cards.\nA few days ago I decided it was time to upgrade from my Beyer DT770s, they are good, but taxing on the ears, and brittle in the top end, whilst lacking bass clarity. I remembered my enlightening hour with the ATH-R70x, and I found them, discounted by £55...\nI havent looked back. By far the best headphones I have ever used, and have shown me so much about my mixes, and what makes the best producers sound good. If you are doubtful because of the price, I implore you to just do it. You seriously wont regret it. This with a Subpac is the best listening environment anyone could hope to have. Thank you Audio Technica!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Amazing amazing amazing. My mixes improved drastically. Open back means deep and warm natural sounds. Need an external soundcard as these run on high ohm. Otherwise they will sound low. The clarify is incredible love the deep bass which made sure I get it right in my mix. I was uncertain between these and the Sennheiser 650 but these are newer, the Sennheiser are 10 years old... BTW the Only negative review here I can't stand, the dude is an idiot who doesn't know how to use these professional amazing headphones properly. Japanese excellence."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Wow!  A friend bought these and after auditioning them I had to have a pair myself.  The \"down to 11\" bass is not an exaggeration yet highs sound sublime also.  My only criticism is that you can't tell the left form the right without examination.  Other than that I see no reason not to buy them unless you're willing to spend a lot more for something better."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"perfect headphones.\nas the publicity says, neutral sounding and comfortable.\ndon't sit there with cheap phones and suffer discomfort from poor sound and ergonomics.\nbuy them and you'll never look back."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Just wanted to thank the clued up reviewers who wrote some excellent reviews informing my decision to get these brilliant headphones.No need to burn these in they work right out of the box,so light and comfortable to wear for long periods.I cannot wait to dive into my collection!!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"By far the best headphones I've ever bought. They are so comfortable and light you can wear them all day. And of course, the sound quality is second to none. If these happened to break tomorrow I'd be straight on amazon buying another pair. Worth every penny."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"For the money as good as you are going to get. Super light, great design, good bass response and a generally lovely sound, a great addition to good speakers for your home studio. The fact that they don't need burn in is amazing. Yes they have high resistance so you could do with a pre amp but it isn't necessary as you shouldn't listen to anything too loud so close to your ear. The direct output from a MacBook Pro is good enough so you can use these on the move to mix if you want/need to.\nIf you are buying them just for listening then they are lovely and won't expose you to the brutal clarity that many of the reference headphones go for whilst still being very clear and with excellent spacial visualisation. As I said for the money you aren't going to get better just different."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Bought with my own cash money.\nNo EQ. No burn in and Exquisite sound straight out of the box. These weigh almost nothing so are incredibly light and comfortable. They may not be able to take a beating but they're not designed for that so I don't understand some of the online negativity surrounding the build quality. Super light is to be commended in my book. I like luxurious materials as much as the next caveman but not everything needs to be made out of grass fed calfskin leather and graphine!\nHaving never used Audio Technicas paddle headband system I was pleasantly surprised and combined with the lightweight design they seem to float next to your ears. They come with no accessories other than a pointless bag and the retail packaging cardboard box they arrive in. So whilst certainly not the last word in comfort or luxury by any means, they work for me and id rather they put the money in the sound.\nWhich is where these shine. Sound signature? Neutral neutral neutral. Accurate accurate accurate. But with an added bonus of a seriously well defined bass. Not Philips Fidelio X2 bass (but that was always too much for these ears) but an accurate well defined bass with great texture.\nHaving recently had some experience with the closed bass monsters that are the Beyer DT1770 and DT150 these R70x's were like a light refreshing shower compared to the muggy humidity of the Beyers. And a welcome audio 'shower' they are too.\nThink Beyer DT880 neutrality but with less sibilant treble and a better well defined bass. And also these don't sound half as thin as the Beyers.\nThink also an open spacious Oppo PM3 with a more present treble - to my ears at least!\nAnd don't be put off by the impedance. I was worried my rig wouldn't be able to handle the 470 ohm but these seem to require less power than the 250 ohm DT1770 and DT150 so they must be an 'efficient' 470 ohm! If there is such a thing!\nI ran them out of my Littledot II MKII tube amp and also on high gain on my Fiio A3 (E11) and ditto on my Fiio E12A and they were had more than enough juice across the board.\nDon't expect the usual Audio Technica MSR7/M50X sound signature and you may be in for a surprise. These are real reference quality neutrality at a reasonable price.\nHope some of this helps.\nStew"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great pair of headphone monitors. Pretty flat very airy sounding which is excellent. Extreamly light and comfortable. Would highly recommend. Tempted to purchase some m70s next to compliment my m50x and now r70x's."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"They are comfy, clean and very good for mixing ! I recommended these for anyone who is mixing and producing EDM. They came very fast, Next day delivery."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"If you are spending this sort of money on open-back headphones you are entitled to expect a spacious, detailed and revealing sound and this is delivered brilliantly by the Audio Technica R70x. I agree completely with the comprehensive reviews written by Stew Tyrrell and T White on these pages, who describe with aplomb how good these headphones sound so I won’t go on too much myself, but I have to mention the bass which is particularly satisfying and well-defined. Far superior in my opinion to the similarly-priced rival AKG K712.  The R70x are not bass monsters, though. They are superbly engaging and satisfying neutral headphones which neither over nor under-emphasise any part of the sound spectrum.\nThe light weight (approx 210g) of these phones is amazing and the wing/paddle system also works very well to make the cans really comfortable. I have an unusually narrow head and often have the opposite problem to some people in that conventional headbands don’t come in far enough for me, but Audio Technica’s system here handled my strange noggin with no problems!\nI am also a glasses wearer and often find over-ear headphones to be uncomfortable whilst wearing glasses. I think I am fussier than most; ultimately I just can’t stand the feel of the earpad pressing against the arm of my glasses but the beauty of these cans is that the earcups are relatively small for an over-ear design so I find I can tilt my glasses out of the way whilst wearing them. The earpad cushioning is soft, though, so if you wear glasses and are not as fussy as me you will probably get on fine with just putting them on as normal. The clamp force is certainly not excessive, but it is also easy to relieve by gently bending the metal headband frame. I would say my ears are average size and they fit snug inside the cup, so if you have larger ears the R70x may not work for you in that respect.\nOther issues with the R70x that have been commented on: Yes, the cable is long at 3m and Audio Technica ought to have included a shorter alternative, but it is thick and does not tangle easily. It terminates in a 3.5mm jack with a screw-on 6.3mm adaptor which is the way I wish all headphone cables were set up.\nI didn’t find the L and R markings difficult to spot inside the headband and in any case my pair has the country of manufacture sticker (Taiwan) on the inside left so I can easily identify the correct way to wear them. And yes, when you first put the cables in it doesn’t matter which plug you use!\nThe impedence is high at 470 ohms but the cans are not ridiculously difficult to drive. They are obviously not intended for portable use, but out of interest I tried them plugged in directly to my iPod and phone (Samsung A3) and both were able to achieve an adequate volume level. However, the difference when I used my iPod with my Fiio E12A headphone amp was significant; they really opened up and showed a fuller dynamic range. An even better result was achieved using an RCA phono to 3.5mm cable direct from my Arcam CD player into the Fiio E12A which made the cans absolutely shine.  This is now my regular home listening set-up until I can afford an Arcam rHead!  On the basis of these experiments I think you will need a headphone amp to get the very best out of the R70xs.\nHaving tried quite a few headphones for home hi-fi listening recently these are absolute winners in this price bracket and are an easy five stars."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"This pair of headphones like many of you already know which belongs to the HD650 category of laid back natural sounding headphones. And quite to my surprise it ended up dethroning the HD650 from the top of my list. It resisted the attack of the Elear and Nighthawk but this time it had fallen. The Elear are brutally heavy which is a pity as I could not stand them even though they reproduced piano even better than my HD800. What a shame. These R70x are light as a feather and the flip side of the coin is that when you unbox them they seem no better than a 15£ pair of cans sold at Walmart. But when your ears take over your eyes and tactile feelings the magic starts. It took me perhaps a whole month to decide to keep them and sell the HD650, while the HD600 are going to stay. The R70x have in my opinion a slightly less precise mid register but they excel in both mid-bass and sub-bass. The high register is very inoffensive but not veiled. When I swith from the HD800 I do not find the R70x veiled, just another flavour of music reproduction which is very suitable for late night listening and non-analytical sessions during day time, when music is not the sole focus of your mind. This of course is just my opinion and others may prefer the HD650. Just a note: if you are one of those who found the HD650 of HD600 boring, I'd stay away from these too."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I don't normally do reviews but these were just so stunning that I just had to. These are my first pair of open back headphones. I was using the Audio Technica M50x's which were really good but these take mixing and production to a whole knew level. As soon as I put them on and started listening, I could hear loads of small errors and details in my mixes that I wasn't able to hear before and when mixing a kick for one of the songs I'm making I could find and fix the problem so much faster than before. Overall these headphones are incredible and I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for headphones that can help create clear and clean mixes."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Love it"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Excellent sound. Wide soundstage, clear highs and bass that doesn't swamp the midrange. Very light and comfortable.\nEar pads are a bit small but can be replaced."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Well I seem to be in a minority of one here as I bought these headphones and am returning them immediately.  For two years I have been mixing with the closed back equivalent of these : the ATH M70X and have been very happy with the results. My mixes have been crystal clear and compare well with my reference tracks - professionally produced album tracks by big names .  Having read a number of articles however, all of which state in no uncertain terms that mixing should really be best carried out via monitors but if you really have to do it on headphones then it should be on open backed ones as the sound quality and results are always better than with closed back, I thought I'd give it a try, but to my horror when I plugged these headphones into the back of my Mac the sound quality had immediately deteriorated drastically along with the level  (I know these have high resistance but this drop was ridiculous)  I had the mac volume full up but despite this there was almost zero output and I honestly couldn't believe what I was hearing. Initially I thought that my mixes with the closed back model must really be so bad that they were being shown up in such a bad light. But no, my reference tracks were also suffering in the same way and had gone from loud and crystal clear to quiet and muddy - like listening with cotton wool in your ears.  So I'm afraid these headphones are being returned immediately for a refund as they simply don't appear to what it says they do on the box and on all the reviews. Maybe I just got a duff set but they really don't compare at all well with the M70X's"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Quiet frankly, just as the song goes, \"I only grow to love you more with each and every day.\"\nIn short ice clear sound is what you will get with these R70X. I must apologise to you now, because please forgive the excitement which is to follow, as I can only say, once you own a pair, within minutes, you too, will surely understand every single word of my review to follow these words. There's none of that 'burning in' befuddlement either - these astound from momento uno. Period. What's more, no matter what genre of music you find yourself playing, you'll also find that every instrument occupies its own distinctly translucent audio space - without needing to borrow any 'soundstage' from any other instrument. The balance between instruments is a technological marvel in itself. How on earth did Audio Technica manage to breath so much magic into one pair of headphones. And did I mention the clarity? Exxxxpletive yeah...The Clarity!!!! It's no understatement to say that their clarity is not of this world: The bass, the mids, the treble, no matter how many headphones I've tested in my time, nothing delivers sound as faultlessly as these headphones.\nWelcome to headphones which are quite undoubtedly the world's most excitingly neutral headphones - & that would be true at even double their price. Their sound quality is, and I cannot stress this enough, not of this world. Now I know why it's so extremely hard, for other reviewers to find a negative word about these R70X. Actually, on that note, I see that some have criticised them for the fact that their wires aren't clearly labelled 'left' or 'right' without realising that Audio Technica have breathed magic into that aspect too - for it truly doesn't matter which side you plug the wires into (and I don't know about you, but I always prefer detachable wires anyway) you will *still* experience left on the left hand side and vice versa. Furthermore, I see that they fit comfortably on people with all kinds of head size, and I might add too that even on my extra large sized head, they fit perfectly too - being so light, you'd hardly notice they're there; and some of you might rightly even wonder whether they're in the box, you'll receive, at all.\nBack to the sound quality: The extraordinary balance between the bass, the mids and the treble, simply has to be heard to be believed. Yes, some headphones are a little bassy, some a bit 'trebley', others have 'recessed mids' yet are otherwise good at the highs and lows;  And so on and so forth; But these R70X just have to be heard to be believed. For instance, I own the M50s and they are nothing like as perfect as these phones, great as they are in their own right.\nTrying to find headphones which deliver a better sound than these give,  and so I will buy another pair as soon as I can afford to do so. I've written over 150 reviews here on Amazon, and never have I liked a product so much, that I can confidently say that to buy these once isn't enough. Seldom do I get so excited about a product that I haven't a single reservation about it  ...until now. You will probably need a pair of these and onlistening to their magic, I won't be the only one who'll quest for a backup pair, especially for when your friends nick 'em from you, after they claim to just (ahem) 'borrow them' to try them out with their own collection.  They too will fall hopelessly entranced with their perfectly balanced sonic clarity.\nI tested them with both hifi equipment, a Boss BR800 mixer, an Elektron Octatrack and the three portable players which follow, and in no way were they anything less than perfect no matter what device I put in their direction.\nIndeed, I have also tried these phones with a Fiio X3, a Hi-dizs AP100 and a Sandisk Clip+, and here are my findings. With the Fiio X3, they are far too quiet on 'low' gain setting. When 'High gain' setting is enabled in settings, I can listen to any music very loud, and would not wish the sound to be louder. The same goes for the Hi-Dizs AP100 which if anything, went to ear splitting levels with these IF that's what you want! As for the Sandisk Clip+, on European setting it's goodnight - you'll unquestionably need to put an amplifier with these R70x. Enable \"rest of the world\" setting, and suddenly you have more than ample volume levels with which to play.\nThis is easily the most deserving 5/5 I've given this year. And so I will be buying a second pair, for backup purposes, if for nothing else, because one pair just isn't enough. Never have any headphones (and I've either tested or owned quite a number in years gone by) inspired me to say, buy these and you truly are buying a one way ticket to 'headphone nirvana'. Purchase these headphones, and believe me you'll feel like a child on Xmas morning, waiting to unwrap the best present of his/her life.\nLastly, I'd love to hear what you think of them too, thank you."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"One doesn't expect thumping bass with open-backed headphones (unless one stumps up for planar) and these don't supply it, much as the bass response isn't insignificant. The clarity and definition are what one might expect from the price range (guessing from my limited experience) and the sound stage is reasonable to good. It's not over easy to get them in a good position on the head for comfort, but maybe it's
