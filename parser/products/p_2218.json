I will try to be as unbaised as possible here, and to give you a more definitive answer I will compare this model with a 2016 Macbook pro, a 6 year old hp envy m6 (which was roughly in the same price bracket when bought new) and a 2018 Ipad.\nI am definitely not an average user, and the number one reason I needed two of these machines was to get ~48GB of ram (in total) and decent CPU performance without spending a fortune, or throwing out perfectly functioning old technology. For me, the cheapest option was to get two T430 and upgrade both with 16GB ram.\nThe way I use both all of these machines together is depicted below:\nMachine 1: HP envy 1TB ssd, 16gb RAM(right monitor): main machine, used primarily for research and data storage.\nMachine 2: Thinkpad T430, the first one (left monitor): with 1TB ssd and 16GB ram: Used for office work and going through video materials: Machine 1 & 2 typically have 4 programs open side by side.\nMachine 3: Ipad 2018 with apple pencil: Used to make notes in onenote (which is synced across all machines), and do graphic designs (hence the apple pencil), which is also synced across all machines.\nMachine 4: Thinkpad T430, the second one (closed on table); currently only used to offload video encoding tasks when Machine 1 and 2 are busy. May eventually consider connecting it to another monitor, if required.\nAll data is synced between machines using cloud storage. If any of these machines fail on the spot, I have the data mirrored between all three of them, which gives me piece of mind. I use software to share a mouse and keyboard between the two machines over the local network.\nT430 impressions:\nFirst of all, for ~300£ this may look like a bargain, and it is, only if you do not require a good screen or good battery life. Having bought 2 so far (and kept both) I feel like a can honestly give feedback on the performance of these models.\nMy use case is very specific: out of all the laptops that I have I use them all with an external monitor + keyboard and mouse the majority of the time.\nThe reasons I chose the t430 are:\n1- cheap\n2- I know for a fact ram/ ssd and cpu are indeed upgradable: this was an the only way for me to fit 1tb ssd into my budget.\n3- This is one of the few laptops you can get in this price bracket that would support enterprise security features, such as TPM.\n4- I have researched these models and can confirm that they do not overheat even under full load (at least, the two laptops I recieved do not). For someone who has another laptop from 2016 which regularly hits 100c at full load, and the HP which cannot run at full load without throttling, this is a big plus.\nCosmetic damage\nThe units do come refurbished, with cosmetic damage here and there: scratches and bumps, but nothing that would stop you from using them. If you care about the clean look, don't get one of these.\nThe screen\nThe screens on these models are ATROCIOUS compared to what you can get in 2018: it doesnt matter if you pick up the 1600x900 or 1366x769 models: both have old TN panels that are just NOT good to look at. The reason why I dont care about that is:\n1- I have been using high quality monitors for the last 6 years, and use the laptops with the monitors for the majority of the time.\nHow to make the screen better: you can theoretically upgrade to an IPS panel, but that is not a trivial fix nor is it cheap, running to about 150£. I solved this problem by getting myself an ASUS pa227ac monitor (which I would strongly recommend). The thinkpad runs that 2k Monitor with no problems, it is even able to play 2K Video with no stuttering. 4K video is out of the question though.\nThe performance\nThe performance of the machine is good, by which I mean it would not have any issues doing common office tasks, browsing, even light gaming potentially. For 300£, you cannot expect a stellar level of performance without some upgrades (see below):\n1- The SSD model you get is a bit of a lottery it seems: One of my units came with a samsung SSD. The other one came with a \"SOLID\" ssd brand, which I have never heard of. Since I knew i will replace all SSD's with brand new ones, I didn't care that much. Both original SSD's were about as fast as each other, booting in about 5 seconds and chewing through common tasks: for example, open office installed itself in under a minute. Both SSD's definitely make the machines feel brand new (even though they are 6 years old!).\n To be on the safe side, I replaced both of those ssd's with brand new mx500 crucial drives: there are SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER than the default drives. with \"overprovisioning\" and \"momentum cache\" turned on via crucials software, I can easily push 300-600mb/s write speeds: for comparison, it takes about 10 seconds to copy a 4gb compressed folder, and about 5 minutes to make the backup of the entire drive (around 30GB of data): pretty impressive.\nTo compare this to my HP envy which has 2 MX500 SSD's in RAID 0 (write speeds of around 1.5GB/s, comparable to brand new macbooks) and a 2016 macbook pro:\nEveryday tasks: there is really no difference between all three laptops. Unless you are working with massive files, copying around 1gb worth of data is near instantaneous on them all: T430 =~=HP=~=2016MBP.\nBIG files (photos, videos etc), over 20GB: the HP and the MBP are definitely faster. Will you notice the speed difference in a blind test though? probably not.\nMultitasking: the T430 only has 8gb of ram, which does make it quite limited if you need to multitask. This should be ok for most people, as you cannot easily get 8gb of ram for a new 300£ laptop even in 2018. The bump to 16GB makes a huge difference: this bump will cost you around 130£, if you choose to do so. Note that 16GB of ram is the maximum this machine supports.\nUpgrade and actual cost of ownership\nI upgraded my thinkpads with a new (bigger) ssd and 16gb of RAM, making my unit cost me closer to 500£ each, and not the 300 odd that is advertised. If I ever decide to upgrade the CPU as well (around 100£ and half a day of work), the performance overall would be on par with brand new  £1200-1500£ machines in 2018 at the expensive of having a good screen and battery life.\nThe price for these does vary, it is definitely a bargain for 300 odd, possibly even 380 if you can find one with 16GB ram.\nIf you buy this with the intension of using this with an external monitor, I would say go for it. If not, it would really depend whether you can tolerate the screen quality. Make no mistake, there is a night and day difffernce between the new IPS screens and old TN panels.\nfor 200£ you can upgade this machine to easily match the new machines of 2018 that cost much more than 500-600£.\nfor 300£ you can get this machine upgraded to 16GB RAM and 1TB SSD, something that you will struggle to find in a budget model in 2018\nOverheating / Heat dissipation performance\n The CPU in this machine does not go over 80c at full load, and even then, the fan noise is not annoying. Having said that, the fans do spin pretty much all the time. It is a quiet hum: if fan noise bothers you, do not get this.\nThinkpad vs IPAD (2018)\nFor circa 500£ (my upgraded thinkpad with 512 SSD and 16GB ram) vs 479 (Ipad with pencil) which one is better for productivity?\nFor simple youtube and consumption, buy the IPAD: the battery life is easily tripple the lenovo, the screen is usable, you can make notes with the apple pencil in onenote etc etc. It is a no brainer here. If you require multitasking and office support and extra connectivity options, the recommendation is more difficult to make.\nI found that even with a keyboard, I simply cannot use the Ipad for everything I use my lenovo for. Several reasons:\n1- The ipad can connect to a keyboard, but you cant connect a mouse. It simply isnt supported.\n2- You can run multiple programs on both (and alt tab works on the ipad to switch between applications by the way), but the ipads screen is far too small to run two programs side by side. The lenovo is in the same boat: I cant use two programs side by side on a 14\" screen. I have been using 27 inch screens for the last 6 years, so that may be the reason.\n3- You are reliant on cloud storage with the ipad: you cannot connect any harddrives (unless its for photos only), there is no real file system. If you already only use google drive / other cloud services, this should be a problem.\n4- As far as I am aware, to connect the ipad to a monitor requires a 50£ dongle, or an appletv or the airbeam app (+ a compatible monitor). Not an easy procedure at all. To connect a lenovo to a display you need  a 12£ minidisplay port to HDMI or a similar cable.\nSome considerations / questions and answers for the T430.\n1- Will the screen be better than the new models?:NO\n2- Would the battery last as long on this T430 as the new models? definitely NO\n3- Would it be more upgradable than most new machines: YES (if this is important to you)\n4- Would the unit last the next 5 years, or am I buying a cheap \"low performance\" machine for the next year?: for non intensive use cases, I do not see a reason why this would not last you. If you require more performance than this machine can provide, get a refurb desktop at around the same price / buy a new desktop. That is the most cost efficient option.\n5- Can you connect several screens to this machine?:  you can connect one 2k screen using displayport. It is possible to connect two by either using Minidisplay port and VGA OR purchasing a dock. Realistiically, I do not think the GPU would be able to drive 2 2K monitors smoothly.\n6: Does this machine support RAID configurations: NO, however nothing is stopping you from settting up software raid."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"So far, so good. In fact, so far quite amazed at what I have for the price. Keep trying to work out the gotcha. Windows 10 64bit pro: check. Fast i5 processor: check. 8GB RAM: check. Fast 256GB SSD drive: check. Battery in good condition with plenty of life: check. Nice keyboard and lots of buttons on the mousepad: check. Twin USB 3.0 ports and 1 2.0 port: check. Functioning wire and wireless connections: check. In fact, so far - trying to spot the flaws in a ridiculously cheap but powerful laptop - I can't spot any! One star removed because I had to spend five minutes giving it a slight clean but honestly, don't let that put you off - we're talking minor, minor issue here and in any case you would probably want to do that with a second hand laptop anyway, right? My main purpose for this laptop is to back up my digital camera SD cards on the road when they fill up (which doing a days wildlife shooting is a real possibility). For the price of this laptop and a cheap external HD drive (for additional security) you get a good, cheap solution. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Well am not sure what refurbishment Refurb IT did to my machine but it looked pretty brand new when it arrived. Delivery would have been as planned except for DHL not being able to read their sat nav resulting in a couple of days delay. I was impressed with the secure packaging that he laptop was sent in. I have had my T430 one month and find it impressive in operation and lightning fast particularly in booting up. I am still wrestling with the mysteries of Windows 10 which I loaded with the aid of Refurb IT instructions but so far so good. This laptop has a very impressive spec and sound quality is excellently. I opted for the 1600x900 screen which I am pleased about. Another bonus with this machine is that it has a DVD writer , something lots of laptops are missing theses days. All in all I am very pleased  with my purchase and hope things will carry on this way."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Excellent compact laptop. Very fast start up and good battery life. I bought it as an additional PC to learn how to use Win 10 (my main PC is on Win 7 and I didn't want to update until I had experience with Win 10).

AVOID the spyware/bloatware by Lenovo and only install the drivers."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"The Laptop I ordered looked too good to be true so I thought I was taking a risk...apparently not.  It was bought for my wife to learn MS products on as she's been out of the office for the time our kids were growing up.\nThe laptop, on which I'm typing this review, arrived very promptly and in impressive protective packaging. On bootup it was ridiculously quick, and installing Norton and office 365 took less than 15 minutes. It boots up like no laptop I have ever owned - and was faster than an MS Surface I have (first gen admittedly) and my works laptop.\nIt's came extremely clean, with very little sign of any wear apart from the ghost of an IT asset label on the lid (can live with that). The screen is sharp, bright and undamaged., the keyboard doesn't look like it's ever been touched.\nCan't praise this enough.\nBut it gets better...had an issue activating Windows, contacted the supplier through Amazon, and had a simple solution in about less than 15 minutes.\nSo impressed I think I'll bin my other laptops and buy one of these for myself!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Customer service was excellent. Computer has no mechanical flaws, worked perfectly and has a years warranty. The marks on the outside of the computer could easily have been made with just one day's normal usage.

Great value for money."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I'd have to say this is an exceptionally good computer.  Fast for one thing, and it boots up super fast.  Refurbished seems more to mean hand build - most of the parts seem to be new.  I don't see any signs of wear or anything and it runs like a new computer.  It was delivered fast and very professionally packaged.  I know Lenovo are a reliable brand, I'd expect to get several years use out of this one.  The size and keyboard are perfect for me.  It's sturdily build like all Levonos but not heavy.  It's pretty high spec for the price.  As I work in IT I know my computers.  This is a well reliable model and a seriously good deal for the price."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Looks just like the former IBM business machine down to the little red button in the middle of the keyboard. I never quite \"got\" that but there you are. I run it with a wireless mouse and disabled the button. There are three USB ports, one USB 2 and two USB 3, one taken by the mouse, so two left which may be insufficient for many. Surprise, surprise it has an optical drive where many present-day laptops don't. Disc drive (given as 278GB), not large but solid state, nice and quick from switched off to ready-to-go (~30 secs) with nice clean installation of Windows 10 (none of the added Lenovo bloatware my desktop came with). Runs Office 2016 faultlessly and fast & I've happily run Nero to create a DVD. No banks of glowing LEDs, lovely positive keyboard. It's a cracking machine. I run it mostly from the mains so I don't know about battery life. Durability: ask me in five years time but if it's any help my Lenovo desktop has had no build or reliability issues in its 5~6 year life. It's solidly built, maybe a little unexpectedly heavyweight but combined with no moving parts in the disk drive I expect it to last and last.\nThis was supplied as certified refurbished & I wouldn't know that it had been used before; it feels new, it was clean and unmarked when it arrived. An excellent buy.\nNegatives, not really any. You will need to download a bit of software from the Lenovo website to know if the \"Caps Lock\" is on as there ain't a little glowing light which is no drawback."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"Why these are described as \"Grade A (Renewed) is a mystery. The item I received was absolutely disgusting with regards cleanliness. Certainly biological evidence of previous user(s) and definitley not been cleaned in any way.\nI suspect that the only thing done in it's so called refurbishment has been a quick wipe over with car trim cleaner (the aroma gave that away) and installing Win 10 onto the 2014, original? Samsung ssd. Examining the cooling fan and heat exchangers revealed that they were full of dust and doing absolutely nothing to reduce the operating temperature.\nThe ssd is designated drives C and D. D was, I suspect the recovery partition. That is allocated 5.3Gb and shows 5.3Gb free of 5.3 Gb, therefore empty and no recovery option.\nThe Windows product key wasn't recognised by MS when attempting to activate. Fortunately I was able to use an existing licence.\nIt did have a 9 cell battery which held a charge very well.\nThe optical drive needs at least three attempts before it remains closed. This has however, been replaced by a \"caddy\" and an additional ssd fitted.\nI realise these are used but they should work properly and be as described.\nVery disappointing."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"So, what's to like?\nQuite a lot, actually. On the parts of the unit that you see -- the top of the lid and the keyboard primarily -- the renovation is excellent. It's just like new. (I've no idea how they do it.)\nThe underside of the computer has a few minor scratches, but who cares?\nThe performance is crisp, with the SSD enabling very brisk boots and switch-offs. This is something important on a laptop in my opinion.\nThe screen is good, but does not rival some of the modern stuff. The detail is there, and the colours, once corrected in the software, seem reasonably strong, but it does not exactly \"pop\". The angle of the screen to the eye is also quite critical for the best \"viewing experience\".\nAnd, as all have agreed, the keyboard is excellent and the build quality solid.\nOh, and the \"Think Light\" situated next to the camera on the top bezel does its job adequately, albeit less elegantly than an illuminated keyboard.\nFinally, battery life, although not formally tested by me, seems to be something of the order of 3 hours. Very acceptable for a second-hand computer, in my opinion.\nThe downside? The price from this vendor seems to go up and down like a yo-yo. I bought mine a few weeks ago for just under £300, thinking it to be a good deal. I notice now that it is available for a lot less."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I have only just received this and so don't feel able to comment on battery life, but it looks and feels very solid and there isn't a mark on it that I can see.  Easy instructions to load Windows 10 operating system - all done in quick time.  The start up is instant.  I am very happy with this and had spent months hmming and haaing over whether to go for a refurbished machine.  A family expert recommended this to me and If you have doubts I would say go for it as the price is very good for the quality and build of this ThinkPad.  Only one thing you might want to note is that it is pretty heavy.  However, I am quite small and I think it would be an issue if I was travelling with it, but not going to be carting it around so no problem."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"The laptop was as described- nearly new condition with very little evidence (if very closely scrutinised) that it is a refurb.

Keys are nice to use, the over-screen light is useful, especially at night.

This one came from Microdream and was accompanied by easy to follow set up instructions.  The battery didn't appear to hold the charge for that long but I think that was due to functions being on that I really didn't need. The lid has a bit flex and I wouldn't be tempted to sit anything on it, when closed. Keyboard is positive and characters nice and large. I need to have the screen at a particular angle for best viewing but that could well be a general fact for all think pads. Anyway, I would recommend a Grade A refurb laptop from this company."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"A decidedly ugly laptop that runs no quicker than anything else I have used for the same kind of money.

I purchased it as a workhorse for my dissertation, thus I use it for coding, reading and typing. The screen is easy on the eyes, the keyboard is wonderful for typing and the laptop is compact enough to use on the move."},{"rating":"1.0","content":"The SSD is not even in a correct case. Instead it's taped in a loose open tray. The SSD is constantly being displaced which results in boot failures. If you're a student or someone who brings a laptop in a bag, you're pretty much going to have to bring a screwdriver with you everywhere so you can manually put the SSD back into place.
