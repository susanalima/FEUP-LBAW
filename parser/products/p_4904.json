Buy this Chromebook understanding that in 6 years (or so) it will overnight become 'unsupported' and therefore no longer receive security patches.\nDo not let this put you off - what other laptop do you expect to cost £250, last 6 years AND still run as fast as day one?\nIts fast enough to do what its made to do; browse the web, watch YouTube in HD etc, but I cant help feel its slower than my previous Chromebook, which on paper its not).\nThe touchscreen is proper and works well. Something I hadn't appreciated is the screen is SUPER GLOSSY (reflective) so using in bright light is frustrating & requires MAX brightness. The hinge feature is slick & feels STRONG, it is used like a tablet as often as not.\nOut of the box I turned it on, 60% charged. Connected it to my Wi-Fi, entered my Gmail account & password & bang, done. I'm not joking when I say its was running it minutes, not hours like a Windows Lenova Yoga laptop I just bought.\nIts whiter than white, and is very light (MUCH lighter than my old Chromebook). I wonder how grubby it'l get over time but the machined metal lid adds some class.\nChoosing over again i'd avoid due to the glossy screen, but IF all touchscreen's are glossy then 100% wouldn't change it, I love the touchscreen."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I ordered an Acer Chromebook from Amazon because I have an Acer Vista laptop which has worked reliably for many years, illustrated on the left in the picture beside the Acer R11 Chromebook. It is important to appreciate that a Chromebook is considerably smaller than a comparable Windows laptop would be. Although the keyboard is physically smaller, the keys themselves are the same size and you can type quite comfortably.\nI got this Chromebook because the Vista operating system is out-of-date for online applications. Getting a Chromebook gets you the latest version of the Chrome browser on a touch screen.\nA Chromebook has a keyboard which is more like a typewriter and does not have all those additional keys you get on a Windows keyboard. This makes the Chromebook ideal for writers and journalists - simple and easy to use.  It boots up very quickly and automatically when you open lid. It goes to sleep when you close the lid, but you can explicitly shut it down to conserve the battery, should you intend not to use it for a while.\nThe Acer R11 Chromebook has a touch screen and can be used as you would use a tablet. If you fold the Chromebook right over, it disables the physical keyboard and a soft keyboard appears on the screen. It is generally quicker to type on the physical keyboard. The fact that it is a touch screen, means you don't need the clutter of a mouse. You can always use the track pad if you need more accuracy than can be achieved by touch.\nYou can install Android apps on a Chromebook and use it as you would an Android tablet. You can also install a LInux terminal. However Android and LInux work in the manner of 'Virtual Box' to protect Chrome OS from accidental deletion and it is important to understand many Linux and Android apps won't work because of this.  (If you need a full Linux installation, you would be better off using VNC to another machine. VNC is available as a Chrome extension. You can SSH to a Raspberry Pi and start VNC. You can also VNC to a Windows computer).\nA point to remember is that a Chromebook does not run any version of the Windows operating system. This means you cannot install something such as Microsoft Word or any part of the Microsoft Office suite. You can however install a text editor which works offline under Linux. There are facilities within Chrome to edit text files, but these depend on your being within range of WiFi.\nThe R11 has two USB ports, an HDMI output, a headphone socket and a slot which accepts standard SD cards as used by your camera, so no problem there. You can connect a mouse, if you prefer that.  You can connect your Chromebook to your television using an HDMI lead and show YouTube videos to all the family. Sound quality using the built in speakers is better than a small tablet such as the Kindle Fire would be, but you can connect headphones or a sound system for more serious listening. The built in speakers are good enough for YouTube.\nThe R11 Chromebook does not have a hard drive or DVD player. It is entirely solid state. There is no fan to cut in and make a noise. Despite being very fast web browsing, it does not get hot while you are using it.\nThere are more expensive Chromebooks, but if you don't want to spend any more than this price, look no further!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Bought one last year for 17 year old and got another one this year for a 16-year-old! They love them and powerful\nVery good value for money and features...offline apps are great and good model too!"},{"rating":"4.0","content":"I am slowly moving away from Windows dependency, and bought this to try out Chrome and discover whether I could work with a small screen and keyboard.  It took a few days to get used to the keyboard (a few keys are different), shortcuts and screen gestures, but I now feel \"at home\".  I still use my larger Windows laptop when possible, but am happy with this as a backup for travelling light.  It boots fast, and uses Android apps, so I feel familiar with the Google environment."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I bought this because an aging IPad was due to for replacement. I considered another tablet but this (although heavier) has the benefit of a real keypad and functions as a tablet by folding the screen back and using the touch screen. Although not a replacement for a laptop or a tablet if used as intended it can do a lot of each and be really useful."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"All in all i am very happy with this product.\nit quite hard to write a review on a laptop without considering the O/S\nI would give the build of the item 5* as it is very sturdy and has excellent battery liffe.\ni am mainly using it for emails, surfing the web and streaming all of which it does very well!\nonly have given this a 4* due to the chromebook O/S a little more restricted than i would have liked and the play store is still in Beta mode (although i have only found a couple of apps that dont work on it."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"For the price, you can't get better. Some may not like that it is white, but I think it stands out. Some may not like that it has a lot of plastic ..., but it is a high-quality plastic and doesn't feel cheap. The keyboard is nice, the touch screen is good, speakers surprisingly good, and the touchpad is usable but not the best. Chrome OS is coming on leaps and bounds, so if you can live with Chrome and Android apps then I highly recommend this PC."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Really pleased by this, my first Chromebook. Very light and very fast (responsive and starts and closes in seconds).\nEasy to set up in settings and runs full android apps from Play store.\nPerfect for media consumption, web browsing, emails, Word documents etc and offers extra 100gb of Google Drive storage when you register (instructions simple and online). SD storage for files, movies etc and HDMI for link to larger screen.\nGreat that it flips all the way around from laptop to display mode to tent and to tablet. Two usb ports, one usb-3.0.\nBought after reading several positive tech website reviews (US and UK). Brilliant for the price."},{"rating":"3.0","content":"This is an excellent machine. The battery life is wonderful, the screen is lovely to touch. It turns on in seconds, very usable. True a few apps won't work, but just the odd one here and there. I'd be tempted to give this 5 stars, in fact, given that it's such a bargain. However, the interface with cloud services through the Word app is pretty shocking - constant problems with file versions and saving changes. For a cloud device that's pretty disappointing. For everything else, it's wonderful. For word processing, it sucks."},{"rating":"4.0","content":"bought this when it was on sale for 199.99 just aswell i orderd when i did it went up later on in the same day. i've found this a great little laptop, easy to use great for web browsing. bought this because i wanted a laptop for portability so i can watch films through it in bed via my old tv (i use pc to stream usually). it does that no problem it does what i usually like to do on my pc great and works foir what i intended it to do. comes on quick and rarther easy to use and i like how i can change it to a tablem by folding the screen back. for me i wanted a tablet but cant be doing without a keyboard so this is agreat cross between a laptop and a tablet. for the price i paid it was worth my money. can't comment on reliability or anything as only had it a day so far however"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Great! Excellent for the price. fast, easy to use. Android apps work with no issues. Light. Great speakers, good touchscreen. Trackpad a bit rubbish, but you can use a mouse-has USB port. Wifi excellent. Great for light work, plays nicely with Ms office online, not so well with the Android office apps. If you want to work a lot locally, without internet, it's not for you, although you can set up googledocs for offline use, which works well. So if googledocs is ok for you& you are not using or making big files, this will still do the job.\nOtherwise top notch."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"Fantastic laptop to take with you.\nI had an older Chromebook that lasted me really well for 4/5 years but decided it needed to be upgraded.\nThe ability to fold although not an absolutely amazing feature is still really nice and allows you the ability to mix up the way your using it and get a better view of the screen if you are in bed or something like that.\nFantastic for university as it's able to do all the basic word processing and note taking you could ever need to do, although I probably wouldn't write an entire essay on it just edit and write a couple hundred words here and there whilst out on campus.\nYou can also run almost any app from the Google Play store which although a bit buggy here and there generally works really well.\nOverall, great to take around with you as it's so light and looks pretty good as well."},{"rating":"5.0","content":"I selected the 'Blue' option but I received a white one; it's only the colour though so I can't complain.\nThe battery life is fantastic and the touchscreen/tablet function makes it stand out from any laptop I've owned previously. It's great for browsing the internet and streaming media, and the Google Play apps make it just like a phone/tablet in the best ways. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"5.0","content":"We now have 3 x Acer Chromebooks in the house, this one (touch screen, convertible) will be useful when we go travelling in our motorhome. The only slight negative point is that the touch screen reflects the light more than the non-touchscreen ones.
