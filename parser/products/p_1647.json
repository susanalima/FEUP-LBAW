I was originally going to go for the system with the AMD FX-850 processor because it is an 8 core CPU (over the Ryzen 2300X's 4) however I later found out that it is an older CPU from 2012 and can only handle DDR3 RAM whereas the newer Ryzen 2300X processor can handle DDR4. I also wanted the default drive to be an SSD to ensure the fastest startup times for Windows, running software and games.\nI ordered the PC on a Friday and it arrived the following Tuesday (2 days ahead of schedule).\nThe PC was extremely well packed, with the box containing the base unit being placed inside a larger box which contained shredded cardboard boxes as packaging. The various empty boxes for the components (GPU, RAM and motherboard) where also inside the package.\nThe base unit for the PC is large, well ventilated and the left side is made up of a clear plastic window so that you can see the interior. The base unit also contains additional slots for extra SSD/HDD drives. The RAM included RAM is 2 x 4GB of DDR4 RAM which I assume was cheaper for them to purchase than a single stick of 8GB DDR4 RAM.\nThe PC was basically plug and play, I had to do the standard initial Windows 10 setup and I downloaded the latest drivers for the Radeon RX570 GPU but apart from that everything worked fine from the get go.\nI have not played any of the latest games on the PC yet as I mainly play Heroes & Generals (a free to play fps game) and Borderlands 2 however these games run exceptionally well on the highest settings.\nI'll mainly be using this PC for video editing and motion graphic design* and the processor & GPU work well with the Adobe Creative Cloud products that I use.  However if you intend to use it for this purpose and have the cash I suggest upgrading the RAM to at least 16GB as programs such as After Effects are heavily dependent on RAM (I looked up the specs for the Gigabyte A320M-H motherboard and they state that it can handle up to 32GB of RAM) and not just the GPU.\n*On a side note the older Ray-Traced 3D renderer within After Effects only works with NVIDIA graphics cards, however the newer CINEMA 4D renderer IS compatible with AMD GPUs and since both renderers have similar functionality it has caused no major problems so far.\nThe only gripe I have is that the included wifi dongle was not very fast, it was OK for checking mail, websites etc but didn't handle video well at all. Fortunately in my case I had a spare dongle which was of higher quality but I would rather that it was not included so that they could knock a few more quid off the price.\nI've only had this PC for a few days now but have had no issues at all with it and think that it is an OUTSTANDING piece of kit for the price. In the future I'll be adding more RAM and an extra SSD drive however the core specs of this budget PC are very solid and its a great platform to further build upon (I will also write an update at some point in the future to state how the PC is running after a few weeks/months of heavy use).\nOverall I would like to thank ADMI for building such a great piece of kit which really helps out those of us who are on a tight budget but need to have a solid PC for gaming and creative software.

In the future I'll be adding more RAM and an extra SSD drive however the core specs of this budget PC are very solid and its a great platform to further build upon (I will also write an update at some point in the future to state how the PC is running after a few weeks/months of heavy use).\nOverall I would like to thank ADMI for building such a great piece of kit which really helps out those of us who are on a tight budget but need to have a solid PC for gaming and creative software. Thank you!"}],"pictures":"\ndata:image/jpeg;base64,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
